### Minor Changes

- 7aea91f: > Created/edited by GitHub Copilot; pending human review.

  Replace separate sanitization and footnote extraction with one deterministic text-normalization contract, canonical Sefaria metadata spans, semantic and content-preserving Masorah markup, and render-ready footnote records.

- 0d11376: > Created/edited by GitHub Copilot; pending human review.

  Transfer toolkit ownership to Sefaria and rename the packages from `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-client`, `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-text-transform`, and `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-web-components` to `@sefaria/api-client`, `@sefaria/text-transform`, and `@sefaria/web-components`. Update imports and registry scope configuration when migrating. New toolkit releases use the MIT license with copyright Sefaria. Retained older releases keep their original bytes, filenames, and licenses.

  New browser releases use `sefaria-api-client.js` instead of `sefaria-client.js`. All three packages now include standalone browser modules, a toolkit license, and dependency notices under `dist/browser`. npm publication remains deferred. The guarded GitHub Packages bootstrap and Sefaria Pages release paths require hosted qualification before activation.

### Patch Changes

- 04dca3a: Publish self-contained browser ES modules `sefaria-client.js` and `sefaria-text-transform.js` beside `sefaria-elements.js` in each script release.
- 4b2448e: Document normalized output grammar, option-controlled attributes, footnote note keys, vocalization ordering, preview normalization, and package summary.
- 0d11376: > Created/edited by GitHub Copilot; pending human review.

  Build each standalone browser module once and reuse its exact packaged bytes for script releases. Validate private build evidence and reject missing or stale inputs instead of rebundling silently. Share CI and first-publication validation and publishing steps while preserving their distinct activation and visibility checks, serialized publication, and verified version output. Retained browser archives and the deferred npm publication policy are unchanged.
