# Sefaria Frontend Toolkit

Bring [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/)'s texts into your product at the level you need: drop in a tag to show a source, or use the JavaScript tools to fetch checked data and clean its text.

A community-driven project with Sefaria backing and support. The toolkit is experimental; names and APIs may change.

## Start here

- To show texts with tags on a page, [use the components](https://sefaria.github.io/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/use-components/start-here.html).
- To fetch checked data or clean text in your own code, [use the data and text tools](https://sefaria.github.io/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/data-and-text-tools/start-here.html).

## Install and status

Install the public npm packages at the synchronized alpha version. Leave out packages you don't need:

```sh
npm install @sefaria/api-client@0.1.0-alpha.0 @sefaria/text-transform@0.1.0-alpha.0 @sefaria/web-components@0.1.0-alpha.0
```

For a page without a build step:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@sefaria/web-components@0.1.0-alpha.0/dist/browser/sefaria-elements.js"
></script>
<sefaria-source-card sref="Micah 6:8"></sefaria-source-card>
```

No registry token is needed. [Install and status](https://sefaria.github.io/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/help/install-and-status.html) covers pinned jsDelivr and UNPKG files, package imports, and the moving npm `alpha` tag.
