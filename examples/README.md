# Examples

These private examples exercise the Sefaria-owned toolkit's public package entry points from the workspace. The examples themselves are not published packages. For an external app, install the numbered public libraries from [Install and status](../docs/help/install-and-status.md#packages); for a page without a build step, use its version-pinned jsDelivr or UNPKG modules. The [framework guide](../docs/use-components/use-with-a-framework.md) shows plain JavaScript, React and Alpine integration.

## Supplied-data component states

The [authored component workbench](explorer/authored.html) renders supplied raw component data and makes zero requests. Use its component, scenario, theme, width, and diagnostics controls, or open a stable deep link directly:

| Component | Public subpath | Retained scenarios | Example deep link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text segment | `@sefaria/web-components/text-segment` | populated, loading, empty, error, markup and footnotes | [Populated text](explorer/authored.html?component=text-segment&scenario=data) |
| Bilingual segment | `@sefaria/web-components/bilingual-segment` | populated, loading, partial, empty, error | [One-sided partial data](explorer/authored.html?component=bilingual-segment&scenario=partial) |
| Source card | `@sefaria/web-components/source-card` | one item, range, hidden addresses, one-sided, loading, empty, error, selection | [Range with diagnostics](explorer/authored.html?component=source-card&scenario=many-items&diagnostics=1) |
| Connections panel | `@sefaria/web-components/connections-panel` | summary, detail, metadata-only, loading, empty, error | [Detailed connections](explorer/authored.html?component=connections-panel&scenario=details) |
| Reader | `@sefaria/web-components/reader` | paired, source-only, connections-only, loading, unavailable, truncated history | [Truncated history](explorer/authored.html?component=reader&scenario=truncated-history&width=720) |

Runnable scenario definitions live in [`explorer/src/authored`](explorer/src/authored/). Selecting an authored scenario never starts a live operation.

## Editable supplied-data projects

The [component playground](playground/index.html?project=source-card) uses one reusable HTML/CSS/plain-JavaScript editor for six maintained projects. Each project renders useful output beside the editable files, validates bounded local payloads through public client schemas, assigns public raw data through properties and scalar configuration through attributes, and makes zero Sefaria requests.

| Project ID | Demonstrated local behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `text-segment` | Select the exact Hebrew or English edition from the supplied response. |
| `bilingual-segment` | Change side order while retaining payload-owned language roles and directions. |
| `source-card` | Select a source row and change vocalization without requesting replacement data. |
| `connections-panel` | Change captured category, page, and preview visibility with zero I/O. |
| `reader` | Change local presentation over exact Micah 6:8 source and links coverage and show an explicit limitation for uncovered navigation. |

Stable built routes use `playground/index.html?project=<id>`. Source and optional request-bearing live-demo links remain trusted controls outside the edited preview.

## Live data and interaction

The [component explorer](explorer/README.md) keeps live actions separate from supplied-data selection. Each page opens without a Sefaria request; **Start live demo** or an example preset begins the operation. The page assigns `sref` as an attribute only after activation, optionally supplies a tagged source property, and lets the element own loading, cancellation, private preparation, and error presentation.

| Destination | What to try | Public package/subpath |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Text segment](explorer/text-segment.html) | Hebrew, English with footnotes, retained markup, absent language, and wrong granularity | `@sefaria/web-components/text-segment` |
| [Bilingual segment](explorer/bilingual-segment.html) | Exact editions, missing translation, ranges, layout, side order, and displayed languages | `@sefaria/web-components/bilingual-segment` |
| [Source card](explorer/source-card.html) | Bounded live source loading, ranges, side selection, layout, and order | `@sefaria/web-components/source-card` |
| [Connections reader](explorer/connections.html) | Source and connection selection, category/page projection, previews, cancellation, visible errors, and exact request counts | `@sefaria/web-components/source-card` and `@sefaria/web-components/connections-panel` |

## Standalone Reader

Open the [standalone Reader](reader/controlled.html?tref=Micah%206%3A8). The deep link only prefills the reference; **Start live demo** assigns the explicit client source property and `sref` attribute to one persistent `<sefaria-reader>`.

## Custom composition

Open the [spatial Reader workspace](reader/index.html?tref=Micah%206%3A8) to see a website host assume additional responsibility for pane placement, activation, pruning, request cancellation, and session pins while reusing shared raw source qualification and the supported semantic/raw Reader session facade. The route waits for **Start live demo** before loading its prefilled reference. It is intentionally distinct from the standalone Reader rather than a competing supported API.

The [React Vite example](react-vite/README.md) demonstrates React 19 custom-element integration: JSX assigns registered inputs as properties, including rich `data` and `source` values. The [Alpine Vite example](alpine-vite/README.md) demonstrates the same Source Card journey with scalar attributes, property-only rich values, declarative event handling, and destroy cleanup.

## Article and MCP host integration

The [authored linked article](linked-article/) progressively enhances ordinary Micah 6:8 Sefaria anchors with Source Card in a host-owned native modal dialog while preserving JavaScript-disabled and modifier-key navigation. The page owns its cache-disabled client choice, activation policy, focus return, visible failures, and cleanup; Source Card owns cancellation and stale suppression; its [README](linked-article/README.md) identifies the public contracts and runnable source.

The [MCP App guide](../docs/examples/reader-inside-ai-chat.md) packages the Reader as a self-contained MCP App. The documentation site includes a click-to-start in-browser MCP client/server and opaque sandbox without an external backend. Run `pnpm dev:mcp` for the compiled Streamable HTTP reference host. The maintained [App](mcp-app/src/app.ts), [host](mcp-app/src/host/), and [server](mcp-app/src/server/) sources keep tool requests host-mediated and transport logic separate from Reader state.
