# Fetch data or clean text

This flow uses two independent packages from the toolkit:

- **The client** fetches from Sefaria's API and checks each JSON response against the corrected API description. Use it when you don't have the data yet.
- **The text tools** turn Sefaria's HTML into safe HTML, keep footnotes separate, and choose which vowel and cantillation marks to show. Use them when you already hold Sefaria HTML.

Use both when you fetch and then display. Neither needs a browser or a DOM, so they run on a server.

## Install

<StatusNote />

Use the package route if your app already has a build step. Use the CDN route if you want no install step.

### Packages

Use `@sefaria/api-client`, `@sefaria/text-transform`, or both. No registry token is needed. The packages need Node.js 22.12 or later.

```sh
npm install @sefaria/api-client@0.1.0-alpha.0 @sefaria/text-transform@0.1.0-alpha.0
```

[Install and status](/help/install-and-status.md) explains exact versions, the npm `alpha` tag, and CDN alternatives.

### No install

Import the client and the text tools straight from the CDN. The client and the text tools are two ES-module files. Load them with `type="module"` or `import`. This needs no token and works in browser pages without an install step.

```html
<script type="module">
  import {
    createSefariaClient,
    text,
  } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@sefaria/api-client@0.1.0-alpha.0/dist/browser/sefaria-api-client.js";
  import { normalizeText } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@sefaria/text-transform@0.1.0-alpha.0/dist/browser/sefaria-text-transform.js";
</script>
```

Import named functions, or use `import * as client from "…"` to take a whole file. A plain script tag without `type="module"` won't work.

These addresses pin `0.1.0-alpha.0`. [Install and status](/help/install-and-status.md#hosted-files) lists the exact UNPKG alternatives and the components' third file.

The examples below import the package names. With the CDN route, use the JavaScript tab of each example and replace each package name with its CDN address. To try an example without either route, press **Run**. The Run buttons on this page use exactly the CDN files.

## Fetch one checked response

<CodeLanguageToggle :snippet="snippets['client-first-success']" />

`createSefariaClient()` makes a client for `https://www.sefaria.org`. `text.getV3Texts` is the generated function for Sefaria's texts API (v3). With no `version` option, Sefaria returns the edition marked primary (`isPrimary`). Here that is the Hebrew Masoretic text.

On success, the result has `data`, and the example prints `Micah 6:8 · he · Miqra according to the Masorah`.

When Sefaria answers with a documented HTTP error, such as 404 for an unknown reference, the result has `error` with the documented error body. Then `data` is undefined. If a response doesn't match the API description, the call throws a `SefariaContractError` instead of returning data. Network failures also throw. They are not turned into empty data.

## Check JSON you already have

<CodeLanguageToggle :snippet="snippets['client-check-json']" />

Use this for JSON that reaches you another way, such as from storage or a file. The example fetches once, stores the response as JSON text, reads it back, and damages one field on purpose.

`validateExternalResponse` returns `{ valid, issues }` and does not throw. The example prints `Invalid at /isSpanning: Invalid input: expected boolean, received string`. Each issue's `instancePath` is a JSON Pointer into the checked value. It points to the place in the data. It doesn't say how to fix it.

Validating isn't cleaning. The check protects your code from a wrong response shape. It doesn't make the text safe to display. See [Clean text and safety](/concepts/clean-text-and-safety.md).

## Clean text you already have

<CodeLanguageToggle :snippet="snippets['text-transform-first-success']" />

This makes no network request. It prints two lines: the normalized HTML, then the same HTML with the cantillation marks removed.

The first line shows what `normalizeText` did. It is the sanitizer. It removed the `onclick` attribute and turned Sefaria's `mam-spi-samekh` class into `data-sefaria-mam="setumah"`, a marker for a closed paragraph break in the Masoretic text. It returns `bodyHtml` and `notes`. The `notes` field holds footnotes kept separately.

`applyVocalizationToHtml(html, "nikkud")` removes the cantillation marks (taamim) and keeps the vowel points (nikkud), as the second line shows. The vowel points are still there. It changes only text, not markup. Normalize first, then vocalize, because the vocalization helper does not make HTML safe. The other modes are `taamim_and_nikkud` and `none`. [Clean up stored Sefaria text](/data-and-text-tools/clean-up-stored-sefaria-text.md) lists exactly which marks each mode removes.

## Fetch and clean text

<CodeLanguageToggle :snippet="snippets['client-and-text-first-success']" />

This example combines the client and the text tools. It asks for `version: ["translation"]`, which returns Sefaria's default translation. Sefaria's default translation is not always English. For Micah 6:8 today it is "THE JPS TANAKH: Gender-Sensitive Edition". After you press Run, it prints the edition title, then the cleaned translation text, then a line saying `1 footnote(s) kept separately.`

Sefaria's poetry `<span class="...">` wrappers are gone. Ordinary formatting such as `<small>` and `<br>` stays. The footnote marker became an empty `<span data-sefaria-note="0">` placeholder. Its content is in `notes[0]`. The example handles one verse. For a range of verses, Sefaria sends `text` as a list, so the example skips any `text` that isn't a string.
