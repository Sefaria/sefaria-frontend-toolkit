# Review guide

This guide defines review gates for the delivered architecture and separately identified planned work.

## Authority and status

- [ ] The change names the owning specification.
- [ ] The change marks planned behavior as planned until implementation exists.
- [ ] Upstream source links use complete commit SHAs.
- [ ] Deployed fixtures include a capture date or immutable source.
- [ ] Record each source conflict in `docs/evidence.md`.
- [ ] Generated declarations remain the field-level transport reference.
- [ ] Private validated component preparation remains the rendering authority; public raw data is not treated as render-ready state.

## Browser script distribution

- [ ] Script-release modules match packaged browser modules byte-for-byte, without a second bundle build or a missing/stale-evidence fallback.
- [ ] Ordinary CI publishes nothing, including with either legacy variable enabled; shared Linux/Windows validation and fail-closed aggregation remain.
- [ ] Actual Changesets inputs produce synchronized numbered versions, including the requested initial `0.1.0-alpha.0`, subsequent alpha and stable transitions, without changing private source/workspace semantics.
- [ ] The dedicated main-only manual npm caller enforces exact reviewed source/version and minimal per-job permissions. Publication/finalization use native `npm-release` approval; setup confirms the designated Sefaria reviewer and main-only policy, with self-review and administrator bypass allowed and no per-run protection API guard.
- [ ] Preparation uploads three actual qualified npm tarballs, a bounded reproducible manifest, checksums and exact maintainer commands to one draft release; source archives are never substitutes.
- [ ] Publication captures those exact assets before approval and invokes neither builder nor packer afterward; npm OIDC belongs only to later automated publication.
- [ ] The plain-HTML smoke loads the actual production module without an import map, source alias, or custom source.
- [ ] Re-evaluating identical bytes through a distinct URL preserves the registered constructors and throws no error.
- [ ] Missing, duplicate, tampered and conflicting assets fail; idempotent preparation never replaces assets. Partial npm publication leaves the draft intact, and explicit resume skips only integrity-confirmed versions.
- [ ] All three public npm records, exact dependencies, integrity and anonymous consumer pass before the same draft is finalized; alpha is a prerelease, not latest.
- [ ] All active versions are restored byte-for-byte; missing/corrupt active archives block deployment.
- [ ] Consumer npm-CDN recommendations are deployed only after hosted qualification. Preparing finished-state copy on an unpublished branch records its contingent merge/deploy gate rather than inventing results. Pages restoration and historical archives remain intact; operational retirement requires separate explicit authorization.
- [ ] Concurrent catalog updates cannot lose earlier records, and stale aliases cannot win by completion order.
- [ ] Runtime dependency notices, corresponding source, file hashes, and independently recomputed sizes accompany each release.
- [ ] Build and validation have no write or OIDC permission; only draft-assets/finalization receive release write permission. Draft-assets owns GET-only preapproval capture because draft visibility requires push access. Only Pages deployment receives Pages identity permissions.
- [ ] Both CDN hosts serve all three exact-version direct browser modules with matching bytes, MIME, CORS and notices before documentation deployment. Hosted availability is not claimed from local checks; retained URLs do not depend on repository redirects.

## OpenAPI pin and overlay

- [ ] The upstream OpenAPI input comes from an explicit Sefaria commit.
- [ ] Each correction identifies the original Sefaria route, handler, response builder, and upstream tests at that commit.
- [ ] Each source link contains the complete commit SHA.
- [ ] A deployed fixture supplements source evidence when runtime data changes the shape.
- [ ] One live response is not the only correction authority.
- [ ] The committed SHA-256 matches the upstream input bytes.
- [ ] Ordinary generation uses no network.
- [ ] Refresh requires an explicit commit and produces a reviewable diff.
- [ ] Every overlay mutation includes an exact JSON Pointer.
- [ ] Every overlay mutation asserts the old value or expected absence.
- [ ] A changed old value fails at the exact JSON path.
- [ ] The error reports expected and actual state.
- [ ] The overlay contains no environment, time, or network dependency.
- [ ] Each correction has evidence and a focused test.
- [ ] Each corrected schema matches the original handler branches and conditional fields.

Review the initial and expanded corrections for:

- [ ] the `/api/texts/versions/{index}` response content key
- [ ] `v3AvailableVersionsTextJson`
- [ ] missing required fields
- [ ] recursive v3 text nesting
- [ ] documented Core error responses
- [ ] `ShapeJSON` property and required-name casing
- [ ] malformed manuscripts response media type
- [ ] approved shared version-metadata and sheet-topic components

## Generated contracts

- [ ] Temporary corrected full-document generation is deterministic.
- [ ] TypeScript `paths`, `components`, operation types, Zod schemas, and runtime validators come from the same temporary corrected document.
- [ ] Generated output identifies its source pin.
- [ ] No handwritten file duplicates a complete generated interface.
- [ ] No generated file has a manual-only edit.
- [ ] Regeneration changes no committed file.
- [ ] The repository check fails after a deliberate stale-output change.

## Thin client

- [ ] The public client uses generated operations directly.
- [ ] All 60 operations are reachable exactly once through the 11 generated tag namespaces.
- [ ] Former flat endpoint exports are absent.
- [ ] The client accepts a configurable base URL.
- [ ] The client accepts an injectable `fetch`.
- [ ] The client has no generalized normalized facade.
- [ ] The client cache is per-client, bounded by TTL, entry count, and retained-body bytes, and can be disabled explicitly.
- [ ] Cache hits pass through the same generated response validation as network responses.
- [ ] Documented errors, legitimate negative results, malformed responses, aborts, dynamic polling or random operations, and submissions are not cached.
- [ ] The cache has no persistence, cross-client sharing, stale fallback, retry, or request coalescing.
- [ ] The client has no retry policy.
- [ ] The client has no request coalescing.
- [ ] The client has no component-specific method.
- [ ] Documented HTTP errors remain typed error payloads.
- [ ] Every JSON success and error response passes its generated validator.
- [ ] Declared PNG responses preserve bytes and metadata, reject a wrong media type, and are never JSON-parsed.
- [ ] An undocumented status rejects as a contract mismatch.
- [ ] A contract mismatch includes the operation, status, structured paths, and original response metadata.
- [ ] Network failures remain rejected Fetch API operations.
- [ ] Aborts preserve abort semantics.
- [ ] No failure becomes a success-shaped object.

## Unknown-boundary validation

- [ ] Unknown MCP, server, fixture, or stored JSON passes a generated validator.
- [ ] Invalid JSON stops before component projection.
- [ ] Every validation error includes a structured JSON path.
- [ ] A test contains more than one invalid nested field.
- [ ] Client response validation and external-boundary validation use the same generated schemas.
- [ ] HTML sanitization remains separate from JSON schema validation.

## Declarative component inputs and source

- [ ] All five public elements accept `sref` and support standalone loading.
- [ ] Text Segment, Bilingual Segment, and Source Card accept component-specific raw `data`.
- [ ] Reader and Connections Panel use tagged source loaders for host-provided data.
- [ ] Defined supplied data makes zero requests, including valid empty data.
- [ ] Invalid supplied data supersedes pending source, replaces prior content with its validation error, and never falls through to `sref`.
- [ ] Clearing `data` resumes retained eligible `sref`; clearing both inputs in one synchronous update yields empty state.
- [ ] Complete endpoint payloads use generated operation/status validation.
- [ ] Narrow selected fragments and response-shaped slices validate only their declared consumed fields.
- [ ] Candidate collections preserve library-owned edition/role selection and reproject with zero I/O.
- [ ] Missing selection evidence is distinct from a known no-match.
- [ ] Supplied and acquired paths produce equal private preparation for the same captured payload and options.
- [ ] Unsafe HTML passes through `@sefaria/text-transform` exactly once.
- [ ] Current failures preserve original causes and structured paths, become accessible state/events, and produce no unhandled rejection.
- [ ] Superseded work publishes neither success nor failure.

## Shared and per-element source

- [ ] One lazy shared source value exists per loaded module instance.
- [ ] Import, supplied data, and explicit per-element source do not realize it.
- [ ] Configuration can replace the pending choice before first shared use.
- [ ] Every configuration call after first shared use fails, including an identical value.
- [ ] Explicit client, host loader, and disabled choices are distinguishable without heuristic duck typing.
- [ ] Explicit failure, disablement, or unsupported operation never falls through to browser HTTP.
- [ ] The client cache remains the only response cache; component source adds no retry, coalescing, persistence, or stale fallback.
- [ ] Disconnection invalidates active work while retaining committed content.
- [ ] Reconnection resumes only still-eligible interrupted work with a new identity.
- [ ] Reconnecting completed unchanged content makes zero requests.
- [ ] Ordinary network failure is not automatically retried.
- [ ] The linked-article host owns its native modal dialog, activation, Escape/button close, focus return, and card cleanup; no Popup API remains in new builds.

## Public and private boundaries

- [ ] Prepared rendering types and protocols are absent from supported declarations, metadata, and exports.
- [ ] `./bindings` and `./reader-controller` remain absent from supported exports and have explicit test dispositions.
- [ ] `./data-source` imports without DOM registration.
- [ ] Component subpaths expose raw input/options/events rather than public prepared-state factories.
- [ ] Parent composition uses captured data and private preparation rather than child `sref`.
- [ ] A parent-intercepted child data action runs one parent default and no child default.
- [ ] Reader remains specialized and exposes semantic entries/raw retained records rather than prepared child rendering.
- [ ] Optional Reader toolbar content and coarse parts preserve their current rendering/accessibility contracts.

### Text segment

- [ ] One optional `language` selects original or translated text; omission selects primary.
- [ ] The former Text Segment `version-language` / `versionLanguage`, `translation-language` / `translationLanguage`, and DOM-free `version.translationLanguage` are absent.
- [ ] Family selection, exact title, and fallback policy compose without a public role switch.
- [ ] Clearing the language returns to primary; selected fragments match explicit family and title.

- [ ] A language-family selector serializes as one `version` value.
- [ ] An exact edition serializes as one `language|versionTitle` value.
- [ ] Every request uses `return_format=default`.
- [ ] Invalid or reserved selectors make zero requests.
- [ ] Invalid or reserved selectors reject both factories with `TypeError`.
- [ ] Language matching does not depend on response order.
- [ ] More than one matching version is a projection error.
- [ ] `projectTextSegmentVersion` projects an already-selected `CoreV3Version` without language-family reselection.
- [ ] Request-based text-segment projection delegates post-selection work to `projectTextSegmentVersion`.
- [ ] Role-based composites resolve sides before they call `projectTextSegmentVersion`.
- [ ] The resolved-version projection owns sanitization, full-mark footnotes, direction, and language; the element derives non-full vocalization only from the immutable safe private prepared state.
- [ ] Request warnings remain with the selector-owning factory or composite.
- [ ] The resolved-version projection does not assign payload warnings to an existing selected version.
- [ ] A composite maps a missing role and its warning without calling the resolved-version projection.
- [ ] Array-valued text is a projection error rather than a first-child fallback.
- [ ] `null`, blank, and sanitized-empty text produce the empty state.
- [ ] Empty states preserve server warning messages.
- [ ] Direction comes from the selected version even when it differs from language expectations.
- [ ] Static footnote markers and available bodies render without adding interaction.
- [ ] A version source becomes a link only after absolute HTTP(S) validation.

### Bilingual segment

- [ ] One request carries both the `primary` and `translation` selectors.
- [ ] Blank references and blank exact version titles make zero requests.
- [ ] Exact selectors claim their matching role version before bare selectors fall back to `isPrimary` and `isSource`.
- [ ] `isPrimary` is not assumed to be unique across versions returned for both selectors.
- [ ] Reversing the payload `versions` array produces an identical private prepared state.
- [ ] A version that fills neither role is dropped.
- [ ] More than one candidate for either role is a projection error.
- [ ] The resolved-version projection is never called for an absent role.
- [ ] Each side's message comes from the warning whose key matches that side's serialized selector.
- [ ] Warning-key matching substitutes a space for each underscore in a requested version title.
- [ ] One absent side gives the partial state; two give the empty state.
- [ ] A child projection error surfaces as a bilingual error rather than an absent side.
- [ ] `contentLanguage`, `layout`, and `sideOrder` remain independent element properties.
- [ ] `sideOrder` applies by role when either side is absent.
- [ ] One visible side uses the full available inline size.
- [ ] `auto` layout responds to container width in both directions without measurement script.
- [ ] Unequal side lengths share a block start without overlap.

### Source card

- [ ] Segment, flat range, spanning range, and nested non-spanning payloads use the same factory and element.
- [ ] A scalar text value produces one item with the root position.
- [ ] Recursive text is flattened from its own shape rather than from `isSpanning`.
- [ ] Primary and translation leaves align by the union of position paths.
- [ ] A one-sided position remains a partial pair instead of being dropped.
- [ ] Empty inner arrays contribute no blank item.
- [ ] Scalar-array disagreement at one path is a projection error.
- [ ] Card items retain positional identity; refs appear only for the reviewed metadata-backed address loader.
- [ ] The payload-derived header makes no second request.
- [ ] Optional host-supplied raw reference-label data changes only header preparation.
- [ ] A ten-item card uses one outer request and zero child requests.
- [ ] Supplied and acquired paths produce equal private preparation for the captured payload.
- [ ] The shared pair renderer produces the bilingual element's established layout behavior.
- [ ] Keyed rendering preserves unchanged item DOM across prepared-state updates.
- [ ] A realistic large payload projects every leaf without truncation or quadratic scanning.

### Source-card selection

- [ ] Selection is opt-in and controlled by positional identity.
- [ ] Scalar, range-start, offset, depth-one, Talmud-prefix, and commentary cases use source-backed address metadata.
- [ ] Empty rows do not renumber later rows or replace the requested first target.
- [ ] Spanning targets expose only the first server-provided context; unsupported nested shapes remain renderable and explicitly nonselectable.
- [ ] Malformed consumed offsets preserve text rendering and report structured paths on an unavailable navigation loader.
- [ ] Every supported item receives a short address label from the same metadata as its canonical target; the element does not parse the ref.
- [ ] Visible primary and translation sides receive Hebrew and English address labels respectively, including conventional Hebrew 15 and 16 forms.
- [ ] Address labels follow stacked and side-by-side pair layout, and hiding them preserves a keyboard-accessible selection control without changing event identity.
- [ ] Host property updates emit no event; user controls emit a composed semantic event.
- [ ] The compact address label remains a real keyboard control, while noninteractive row clicks select without intercepting embedded controls or active text selection.
- [ ] Selection controls remain keyboard operable and `revealSelection()` makes no request.

### Connections panel

- [ ] The request uses `getLinks` with explicit text and sheet settings.
- [ ] All text categories have summaries and reusable detail rendering; sheets are excluded.
- [ ] Counts use unique IDs and do not count expanded anchors as separate connections.
- [ ] Identical duplicate IDs collapse and conflicting duplicate IDs fail projection.
- [ ] Category and entry order is stable across payload order.
- [ ] Each page contains at most 20 entries; out-of-range pages remain explicit.
- [ ] Preview states distinguish available, absent, partial, hidden, and not requested.
- [ ] Connected text is bounded by rendered graphemes with balanced safe HTML.
- [ ] Reported edition/license metadata does not claim unsupported fragment attribution.
- [ ] One page with ten preview entries makes one links request and zero child requests.
- [ ] Category/page/preview-display changes over a captured response make zero requests.
- [ ] Connection, category, page, and preview-request events are composed and keyboard reachable.

### Reader session and declarative element

- [ ] External root replacement keeps old committed source, selection, history, and presentation until qualified source admission succeeds.
- [ ] Source, context, addressability, request-mismatch, pin, and budget failures do not partially replace or evict the old root.
- [ ] A successful replacement creates one fresh entry, removes all old breadcrumbs, resets the truncated-history boundary, and never reuses entry, operation, or pin identities.
- [ ] Any actual pinned entry rejects replacement until the owning host releases its real pin.
- [ ] Source admission publishes before connections start; links failure preserves the new source with an explicit failed slot.
- [ ] Requested, server-qualified, contextual, and committed selected references remain distinct, and no alias uses arbitrary string parsing or a first-row fallback.
- [ ] An invalid replacement is rejected before superseding valid work; a newer valid action aborts older physical work and rejects ignored-abort completion.
- [ ] Fresh-root presentation uses existing defaults unless explicitly supplied, while connection-follow navigation retains normal history behavior.
- [ ] Browser and MCP paths use the same Reader admission semantics without a private wire-format change; MCP continuation remains host-proxied.

## Composite request counts

- [ ] The composite element owns the outer request.
- [ ] Child rendering uses captured parent data and private preparation.
- [ ] The parent does not assign child `sref` or trigger child source.
- [ ] A request spy proves one outer request.
- [ ] The same spy proves zero child requests.
- [ ] A ten-child fixture produces ten child renderings from one captured payload.

## Element rendering and interactions

- [ ] Every public element accepts its documented `sref`, raw `data`, source, visual, and interaction properties.
- [ ] No element accepts arbitrary `fetch`, a base URL, or an untyped host.
- [ ] Private prepared rendering is not writable through a supported property.
- [ ] Layout and interaction remain element properties.
- [ ] User actions emit semantic composed events containing no client or raw payload.
- [ ] Deferred defaults honor `preventDefault()` and verify that the originating state remains current.
- [ ] A parent that owns a child data action prevents the child default and emits one parent action.
- [ ] Application task state does not become a second renderer for the same surface.
- [ ] Captured-data coverage is explicit; empty rendering does not establish coverage.

## MCP integration

- [ ] `structuredContent` contains a corrected API payload.
- [ ] Namespaced tool-result metadata contains only fixed operation identity, a documented status, and the exact request reference.
- [ ] Invalid metadata stops before payload validation.
- [ ] The App validates the unknown payload with the generated TypeScript validator.
- [ ] The App reports structured paths for invalid payloads.
- [ ] The App supplies a validated tagged host loader.
- [ ] The Reader uses the same private preparation as browser-client mode.
- [ ] The first render makes zero requests.
- [ ] Later Reader source uses host-proxied tools only and never falls back to direct HTTP.
- [ ] One tool result includes useful text content for hosts without App rendering.
- [ ] The server preserves network and undocumented HTTP failures as tool failures.
- [ ] Automated repository checks mock the server transport and remain offline.
- [ ] The server sends no component HTML.
- [ ] The implementation adds no hydration path.
- [ ] The writer, validator, App, and fixture migrate atomically.
- [ ] Remove the alternate private wire format in that change.
- [ ] No dual-reader compatibility path remains.

## Authored linked-article integration

- [ ] The authored citation retains native navigation with JavaScript disabled.
- [ ] Eligible primary or keyboard activation opens a native modal dialog and performs one Source Card request with the client cache disabled.
- [ ] Modifier, alternate-target, download, and non-primary activation remains native.
- [ ] Unknown fixture JSON passes through the public client validation boundary.
- [ ] Source Card styles remain shadow-isolated; dialog styles are scoped to the host-owned dialog.
- [ ] Close, supersession, and destroy abort owned work and reject late completion.
- [ ] Destroy removes only owned listeners and dialog state and restores prior accessibility attributes.
- [ ] Each new opening makes one v3 request; the same active reference does not restart source.
- [ ] CSP, mixed-content, CORS, and restricted-page limitations are documented.

## Supplied-data editor

- [ ] The dedicated editor host has a leading CSP meta before executable assets and does not impose its `frame-src data:` policy on unrelated VitePress pages.
- [ ] Edited HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enter only the opaque sandboxed data-document frame.
- [ ] Trusted setup, source, and live-demo links remain outside the edited frame.
- [ ] The child policy denies connect, nested frame, worker, object, media, manifest, form, and base capabilities.
- [ ] The current frame window plus cryptographic channel and run identifiers are required for bounded diagnostics.
- [ ] Exact source, total, diagnostic, message, and active-preview limits have at-limit and over-limit tests.
- [ ] Declared local assets have separate raw UTF-8 per-file and per-project limits with at-limit, over-limit, and non-ASCII tests.
- [ ] The catalog contains exactly the maintained project IDs, and an unknown nonempty ID executes no fallback project.
- [ ] Every project visibly responds to edits in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Reset restores maintained behavior, and one supported interaction is exercised.
- [ ] Supplied Reader coverage resolves only declared requests and reports uncovered navigation without fabricated empty content or network access.
- [ ] Pure subpath import, root registration, shared client identity, both deployment bases, ordinary-page embedding, and Chromium/Firefox/WebKit behavior are qualified without `bypassCSP`.
- [ ] The review does not claim CPU, heap, process isolation, every Safari device, or tight-loop recovery.

## Text processing

- [ ] Vocalization runs on text content, not raw markup.
- [ ] PASEQ behavior is explicit in tests.
- [ ] Sanitization uses an explicit allowlist.
- [ ] Options can narrow but not expand the allowlist.
- [ ] Event attributes, active content, styles, and dangerous URLs do not survive.
- [ ] Footnote extraction preserves marker order.
- [ ] Missing footnote bodies do not appear as a confirmed empty list.
- [ ] Unicode failures report code points.
- [ ] The package imports no client, element, or browser DOM global.

## DOM and accessibility

- [ ] Each public element uses an open shadow root.
- [ ] Components emit no global style.
- [ ] Custom properties use the `--sefaria-*` prefix.
- [ ] Direction comes from prepared-state data.
- [ ] Text Segment and Bilingual Segment render no edition attribution and expose no attribution-hiding property.
- [ ] A source card renders each visible resolved edition's attribution once outside its item collection.
- [ ] `hideAttributions` on Source Card and Reader defaults to false, and enabling it changes rendering without discarding prepared-state attribution.
- [ ] A source card links the edition title for a validated HTTP(S) `versionSourceUrl` and keeps other source text inert.
- [ ] The linked-article dialog displays Source Card attribution.
- [ ] Interactive controls use native elements and accessible names.
- [ ] Focus is visible.
- [ ] The host modal dialog cycles Tab and Shift+Tab.
- [ ] Escape closes the host dialog and focus returns to the originating link.
- [ ] Events cross the shadow boundary when hosts must handle them.

## Documentation

- [ ] Normative behavior is in `docs/specs`.
- [ ] Stable ownership is in `docs/design.md`.
- [ ] Observations and provenance are in `docs/evidence.md`.
- [ ] Current and planned behavior are distinct.
- [ ] Diagrams identify external payloads, runtime dependencies, type-only dependencies, orchestration, and DOM rendering.
- [ ] Normative documents contain no mutable issue or delivery DAG.
- [ ] No document claims human review without actual review.
- [ ] Markdown prose is not hard-wrapped.
- [ ] Links target current documents.

## Final integration policy

- [ ] Active runtime and build paths contain no Python dependency or retired demo assembly.
- [ ] Every package, example, and test-workspace manifest remains private.
- [ ] Library exports and packed files resolve built artifacts rather than producer source.
- [ ] Ordinary CI publishes nothing. Manual npm release and Pages workflows retain their exact admitted permissions and activation contracts; no GitHub Packages publisher, package-publishing flag or long-lived npm credential is introduced.
- [ ] The lockfile contains no mirror-specific remote tarball resolution.
- [ ] Maintained entry documentation distinguishes private workspace/local-tarball use, numbered public npm packages, version-pinned npm CDN modules and historical Pages scripts. It states that APIs may change, preserves Sefaria ownership/support and MIT/hackathon context, and keeps unverified rollout claims in the evidence record.
- [ ] Every retained test from the immutable baseline inventory is present in Vitest discovery; every retirement has a precise presentation-only or supersession reason.
- [ ] Fresh agent setup uses the frozen lockfile and committed source-stamped inventories without historical Git objects, installs Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, and proves all three headless launches.
- [ ] Toolkit setup is selected by checked-out package loader rather than one exact branch name.
- [ ] An unrelated checkout skips toolkit setup explicitly; a malformed recognized toolkit fails.
- [ ] Linux and Windows each run the complete `pnpm check`; the required `check` fails for a failed, canceled, or skipped matrix.
- [ ] Failure artifacts use an explicit bounded allowlist and exclude authenticated captures, dependencies, credentials, and complete workspaces.
- [ ] The setup-only default-branch bootstrap contains no toolkit source or repository-settings change, and its existing Pages consequence is reviewed.

## TypeScript toolchain

- [ ] `pnpm lint` uses only the explicitly configured native Oxlint rules; it does not inherit new default categories.
- [ ] TypeScript typechecking remains a separate compiler command.
- [ ] The workspace compiler resolves to TypeScript 7.0.2.
- [ ] Only `packages/client` resolves TypeScript 6.0.3 for `@hey-api/openapi-ts`, and its build/typecheck scripts invoke the workspace-root compiler.
- [ ] The API-documentation check removes prior output before declaration emission.
- [ ] The API-documentation check includes handwritten package source and client scripts, excludes generated declarations, and fails on missing expected output.
- [ ] Exported declarations, exported interface properties, and public class properties retain JSDoc in emitted declarations.
- [ ] Compiler-emitted private fields do not require documentation.
- [ ] The toolchain regression tests prove type-import, explicit-`any`, JavaScript undefined-name, duplicate-parameter, and legacy-octal failures.

## Final commands

Run the current complete check after code or configuration changes:

```powershell
pnpm setup:agent
pnpm check
```

After the OpenAPI workflow exists, the complete check must include the offline generation and stale-output check.

For documentation-only changes, run the repository Prettier command and `git diff --check`.

See [Keep the documentation current](development.md#keep-the-documentation-current) for page ownership and freshness rules.
