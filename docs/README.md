# Documentation

Use the [product site](https://sefaria.github.io/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/) for the public learning path and interactive previews. This repository index also links contributor-only specifications, evidence, setup, and review material that is intentionally excluded from VitePress.

The three public npm packages share numbered release `0.1.0-alpha.0` under the `alpha` dist-tag. [Install and status](help/install-and-status.md) lists exact-version package commands and jsDelivr/UNPKG browser files. Browser examples can be evaluated without cloning; repository development and release qualification use the contributor documentation below.
