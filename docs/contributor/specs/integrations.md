# Integration specification

## Status

The documentation site, supplied-data editor, standalone and spatial website Readers, MCP App, and authored linked-article integration are current. Their declarative component-input migration is implemented. The host-dialog preview replacement and five-project editor are implemented.

## Shared rules

Integrations consume built artifacts and public package contracts. They own host input, explicit activation policy, external unknown-JSON validation, optional source creation, placement, and application-specific coordination.

An integration assigns component-specific raw `data`, a tagged data loader, or `sref`. It may assign only the documented tagged data source choice. It must not give an element arbitrary `fetch`, a base URL, an untyped host, unknown JSON, or public prepared rendering.

Unknown server, fixture, stored, user, or MCP JSON passes a public corrected client schema or generated validator before element admission. Validation failures report structured paths.

## Activation and traffic policy

Maintained live pages remain explicitly activation-gated. Page arrival, route hydration, deep links, and prefilled query values make no Sefaria request. Only a click, keyboard activation, form submission, example preset, authored citation, or equivalent approved action assigns live `sref` or invokes a host tool.

The supplied-data editor creates no client and makes no live request. Documentation snippets may show immediate `sref` when they are non-executing.

Transport semantics remain unchanged: documented HTTP payloads retain their typed status behavior; network and abort failures remain failures. Integrations add no retry, coalescing, stale fallback, persistence, or response cache beyond the client's bounded per-client cache.

## Supplied-data editor

The editor exposes five maintained projects. Each validates fixed corrected payloads and assigns raw component data or local-data source capabilities. It does not retain public controllers, bindings, prepared models, a fetch broker, runtime package installation, CDN loading, service workers, or a live-data fallback.

The trusted host owns project selection, editor state, source links, bounded diagnostics, and preview replacement. Edited code runs only in the opaque sandboxed frame under the existing CSP and finite source/asset/message limits.

The Reader project declares exact finite `Micah 6:8` source and links coverage. Covered actions use saved records; uncovered navigation reports an explicit limitation without fabricating empty data or requesting.

## Documentation site

The VitePress site embeds isolated production builds and does not server-render or hydrate toolkit component HTML. Landing pages, authored previews, live routes, and reference deep links produce no unsolicited Sefaria traffic.

Request policy and deterministic fixture dispatch classify every permitted declarative request shape. Unexpected origins, methods, paths, references, selectors, and query parameters remain denied.

## Website integrations

### Standalone components

The vanilla, React, Alpine, and explorer hosts teach supplied `data` first. Their explicit live action clears authoritative data when applicable, assigns `sref`, and optionally supplies an explicit toolkit client data source. The element owns cancellation, stale suppression, private preparation, status, and error events.

### Standalone Reader

The ordinary website Reader uses one persistent `<sefaria-reader>`. After **Start live demo**, the host assigns an explicit client source and `sref`. Later external roots assign a new `sref`; the Reader transactionally admits the new root and starts a fresh root history without replacing the element.

The host may place a page-owned action in `toolbar-actions` and read `reader.selectedRef` when it activates. The action adds no request or persistence contract.

### Spatial Reader

The spatial example uses one `reader-session` for semantic entries, exact capture coverage, pins, and bounded retention. Its host separately owns pane IDs, placement, compact selection, descendant pruning, cancellation timing, and visible limits.

The spatial host uses semantic `ReaderEntryInfo` and immutable raw `ReaderSourceRecord`/`ReaderConnectionsRecord`; it does not inspect prepared rendering. One parent capture prepares child surfaces without child source.

## MCP App

MCP `structuredContent` carries a corrected API payload. Namespaced metadata carries only the operation identity, documented status, and exact request needed to select the validator and serve a local-data loader.

The first App render validates the unknown boundary and supplies a local-data loader, making zero duplicate requests. Later Reader work uses a tagged host loader whose only transport is a supported host-proxied tool call. The App and elements never fall back to direct Sefaria HTTP.

The Node tools remain stateless. Reader semantic history and raw records remain in the App/session. `ui/message` is reserved for the separate explicit chat-export action; it is not Reader data transport.

The browser-embedded reference host continues to prove the packaged App, official AppBridge handshake, opaque sandbox, tool/resource discovery, exact request counts, continuing same-App navigation, cancellation, and cleanup. It does not replace stdio, Streamable HTTP, or named-host qualification.

## Authored linked article

The article retains ordinary Sefaria anchors and native navigation. Eligible unmodified primary or keyboard activation opens a host-owned native modal `<dialog>` containing `<sefaria-source-card>` and assigns the card's `sref`. Modifier, alternate-target, download, already-prevented, and non-primary activation remain native. Missing or invalid authored reference/URL inputs are not enhanced.

The host owns the dialog's accessible name, initial close-button focus, responsive scrollable layout, Escape/button closing, and return of focus to the originating link when it remains connected. Background content is inert while the modal is open. No anchored placement or Popup-specific 20-position truncation remains: the preview uses ordinary Source Card rendering.

The page uses an explicit cache-disabled client data source. Source Card owns validation, private preparation, loading/empty/partial states, cancellation, and stale-result suppression. The same active reference does not restart source. Close and destroy clear the reference and disconnect the active card; reopening starts one fresh request. A changed reference supersedes pending work. Late completion or a queued close from an obsolete opening must not affect a newer preview.

Current `sefaria-source-card-error` closes the dialog, returns focus, and announces the original failure in visible host status; only another eligible activation retries. The host removes only its own nodes and listeners and restores any accessibility attributes it replaced on authored links. Destroy is idempotent. Missing originating links do not cause focus errors.

The integration does not detect citations, extract article text, submit a Linker task, poll, hover-activate, bulk preload, rewrite prose, or install a global script.

## Composition and request counts

### Preferred translations

Examples document `translation-language` separately from presentation-only `content-language` and strict exact-edition titles. The live Source Card explorer demonstrates French Micah 6:8 and unavailable-French Berakhot 2a:1 behind explicit activation. A successful preferred request uses one text operation; unavailable-language fallback uses two, with actual-edition attribution and no child requests.

The MCP demonstration's existing default-only text adapter remains an explicit host limitation for non-default selectors. Unsupported selection must fail visibly without direct browser HTTP or substituted default success. Extending that demonstration's tool contract is separate from the component loader's support for serialized v3 selectors.

If an integration already owns corrected data, it supplies raw data for immutable elements or a local-data loader for mutable elements. A parent element or session privately prepares child content from that capture. It must not assign child `sref`.

Ten child renderings from one parent response require one outer request and zero child requests.

## Failure rules

| Failure | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid external JSON | Stop before element admission and report structured paths |
| Documented HTTP payload | Preserve documented status semantics |
| Network or abort rejection | Preserve the failure; do not manufacture empty content |
| Current element failure | Accessible state plus documented error event |
| Superseded completion | Publish neither success nor failure |
| Unsupported explicit loader | Fail without browser HTTP fallback |
| Uncovered supplied Reader target | Report an explicit host limitation |
| Disconnection | Abort/invalidate eligible work; reconnect only the still-eligible phase |

## Completion criteria

- all five public elements use declarative inputs in maintained integrations
- no maintained integration constructs public prepared rendering, owner controllers, or bindings
- supplied paths make zero requests
- live pages retain explicit activation gates
- MCP continuation remains host-proxied
- the linked article proves modal keyboard access, Escape/button close, focus return, native navigation, exact request counts, and cleanup without a Popup element
- Reader and composite request-count rules are tested
- deterministic checks remain offline
