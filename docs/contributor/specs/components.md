# Component specification

## Status

The declarative standalone-loading cutover is implemented. All five public elements accept `sref`. Only Text Segment, Bilingual Segment, and Source Card accept component-specific raw `data`; supplied `data` is authoritative and makes zero requests, including validly empty or invalid data. Reader and Connections Panel do not accept `data`; hosts that need local payloads for mutable surfaces provide a tagged data loader.

Unrelated future component slices remain planned where identified in [Development](../development.md).

## Boundary

Each element owns one reactive input snapshot, validates authoritative supplied input or acquires corrected endpoint data, prepares rendering privately, and renders Shadow DOM.

```

The corrected generated contract is transport authority. Component validation, selection, normalization, and private preparation are rendering authority. Public raw input is not render-ready state.

## Input precedence

For the four non-Reader elements, `data !== undefined` selects supplied mode.

- Valid data makes zero requests.
- Valid empty data remains authoritative.
- Invalid data supersedes pending source, replaces prior content with an accessible validation failure, and never falls through to `sref`.
- Clearing `data` resumes a retained eligible `sref`.
- Clearing `data` and `sref` in one synchronous update yields empty state.

Synchronous writes form one scheduled snapshot. Arrays and objects are replaced rather than mutated in place.

Reader `sref` is the requested root, not the current navigation position. Local Reader data is supplied through `source={kind: "custom", loader}` where the loader implements `getText` and `getLinks` for supported refs from a local map and fails or delegates for unsupported refs. Equal root reassignment is a no-op.

## Raw supplied-data forms

Complete endpoint responses use generated operation/status validators. Narrow selected fragments and response-shaped slices use component-specific validators over only the corrected fields they consume.

Text-bearing components accept response-shaped candidate collections and, where documented, already-selected fragments. Candidate collections retain the evidence required for language, exact-edition, primary, source, or translation selection. Missing selection evidence is distinct from a known no-match.

Text Segment with only `sref` uses the v3 `version=primary` default. Explicit language-family or exact-version selection remains available and reprojects supplied candidate data with zero I/O.

## DataSource

Choose where the component gets its data: use a toolkit client, provide a custom loader, or disable loading. A custom loader supplies `getText`, `getLinks`, or both, using local data or your own service.

### Language and edition selection

`content-language` selects visible sides, independently of source. Text Segment accepts one optional `language`; Bilingual Segment, Source Card, and Reader accept `translation-language`. Both take a full English language-family name such as `french`, not a short code. All four accept `translation-fallback`, either `default` or `none`. Missing preferences retain the existing default selection. Blank preferences and reserved role selectors are invalid; family names are trimmed and lowercased before serialization. Invalid `translation-fallback` values use the same accessible invalid-input error path as an invalid language preference and cancel pending work. Text Segment and Bilingual Segment default `translation-fallback` to `none`; Source Card and Reader default it to `default`.

Text Segment uses `language` for either original or translated text, without a public role switch. Omitting it selects `primary`; a title without a language selects `primary|title`. An explicit language selects that family, with an optional `version-title`. The former Text Segment `version-language` / `versionLanguage` and `translation-language` / `translationLanguage` inputs are removed without aliases in the next alpha. Bilingual Segment, Source Card, and Reader retain their translation-specific preference and use `primary-version-title` and `translation-version-title`. A title combined with a preferred family selects `family|title`; exact titles never silently fall back.

DOM-free Text Segment requests use `version: { language?, versionTitle? }`, with an optional `translationFallback` of `default` or `none`, and use the same private preparation as the corresponding element attributes. An empty selection object selects primary. The former `version.translationLanguage` is removed. DOM-free Bilingual Segment, Source Card, and Reader request types also accept optional `translationFallback`.

Request the preferred language directly: one `version=french` for Text Segment, or `version=primary&version=french` for bilingual content. With `translation-fallback="default"`, only a validated, matching missing-language warning with no contradictory returned candidate allows one further request for Sefaria's default `translation`. That default is not guaranteed to be English. The fallback request includes the primary selector again for bilingual content, so its response remains one complete corrected capture rather than a synthetic merge. With `translation-fallback="none"`, the same warning is a terminal no-translation selection: Text Segment becomes empty with the visible status message `No french text.`, while Bilingual Segment, Source Card, and Reader keep any renderable primary side and render `No french text.` in the translation side; if no side is renderable, they become empty with that message. This state is not an error, emits no error event, and does not use an alert. A present-but-empty preferred edition remains selected. HTTP, network, abort, validation, and projection failures do not trigger fallback.

Missing-language means warning code 102 for the requested family. An acquired response omitting that family without the warning is an source validation failure, not evidence to use an unrelated returned edition. If the default request reports no translation (warning 104), Text Segment is empty; bilingual content retains a renderable primary side and explicitly reports the absent translation. With neither side renderable, the result is empty.

Selection uses language-family and role evidence, not response position or the legacy `language` field. Text Segment explicit-family selection permits source editions as well as translations; primary selection requires `isPrimary`. Selected fragments must match an explicit family and exact title; without those preferences their already-selected metadata remains authoritative. Supplied data always makes zero requests and applies the same `translation-fallback` rule. If availability metadata advertises a preferred edition whose text is not captured, report missing selection coverage instead of acquiring or substituting a default. With `translation-fallback="none"`, a supplied preferred response carrying warning 102, a candidate collection lacking the family, or a supplied final-fallback capture prepares the same `No french text.` state as source. With `translation-fallback="default"`, a supplied final fallback capture and the same acquired capture produce equal private preparation.

Show actual edition titles and the actual edition's language-family name. Source Card and Reader label each displayed edition with one language name only, the canonical `languageFamilyName` also used by `translation-language` and Text Segment's `language` (for example `(hebrew)`), and never append the `actualLanguage` code. Source Card and Reader attribute once per displayed side; standalone Text Segment and Bilingual Segment display no attribution and accept no attribution-hiding property. Parent-owned child rendering suppresses repeated attribution privately. A fallback explanation identifies the unavailable preferred family and actual selected language for Source Card and Reader; standalone Text Segment and Bilingual Segment carry no such notice, since they no longer render selected-edition metadata. Never label a French record English merely because its legacy `language` field is `en`.

Reader propagates the preferred family and fallback setting to navigated sources and contextual expansion. Root exact titles apply to that root and its context, not unrelated connection targets. DataSource selectors and fallback mode participate in request identity, retained-source reuse, cancellation, and transactional root replacement. A loader response that does not cover the requested operation remains an explicit source failure, not permission for browser fallback.

Invalid selection attributes cancel pending source work before reporting the error, so an ignored-abort response cannot commit a superseded selection or erase that error.

Preferred success, strict editions, defaults, and missing-language selections with `translation-fallback="none"` use one outer text request. Missing-language fallback with `translation-fallback="default"` uses at most two, always with zero child requests. Reader's existing target-plus-context qualification may perform two such source operations. Presentation changes and unchanged completed reconnects add no requests. Fallback is component selection, not a client retry or source-source fallback.

These counts describe uninterrupted operations. Disconnection may abort an in-flight request; reconnecting unchanged inputs resumes that request with a new signal, without repeating the completed preferred-language phase. Reader retains its in-flight target qualification while context is interrupted. This operation-local progress is discarded on supersession or completion, not stored as a second response cache.

Connections Panel keeps API-provided links previews without per-link edition source. No Popup language inputs are added.

Each element accepts an optional tagged `SefariaDataSource`:

- `{ kind: "client", client }`
- `{ kind: "custom", loader }`
- `{ kind: "disabled" }`

An undefined value uses one lazy shared data source choice per loaded module instance. Import, supplied-data rendering, and explicit per-element source do not realize it. `configureSefariaDataSource` can replace the pending choice before first shared use; every later call fails, including an identical value.

Explicit failure, disablement, or an unsupported loader operation never falls through to browser HTTP. The client cache remains the only response cache. Elements add no retry, coalescing, persistence, stale fallback, or second cache.

## Lifecycle and failures

Detached elements start no source. Disconnection aborts or invalidates active work while retaining committed content. Reconnection resumes only the still-eligible interrupted phase with a new operation identity. Reconnecting unchanged completed content makes zero requests. Ordinary network failure is not retried automatically.

Current validation, projection, source, network, and abort failures become accessible element state and documented component-specific error events. Original causes and structured validation paths remain available where the event contract provides them. Superseded work publishes neither success nor failure and produces no unhandled rejection.

## Public and private API

The root entry registers all five elements. The DOM-free `./data-source` entry exposes data-source configuration and types. Component subpaths expose component-specific raw request/selection types. `./reader` exposes shared raw source qualification, browser data-source construction, and resolved-source records. `./reader-session` remains a supported advanced DOM-free semantic/raw facade.

Prepared rendering types and protocols are private. `./bindings` and `./reader-controller` are retired and absent from supported exports. Elements expose no arbitrary `fetch`, base URL, untyped host, public prepared model, or request-capable child protocol.

Ordinary browser hosts use attributes for scalar public inputs, including `sref`, enum presentation choices, numbers, strings, and default-false boolean flags. A default-true boolean that must be set false remains a property exception because HTML boolean attributes cannot represent false by presence. Raw `data`, tagged `source`, arrays and other rich values remain property-only. React 19 JSX may express both groups as props because React assigns registered custom-element properties directly.

Public read-only `status` reports the element's current semantic state. Reader additionally exposes read-only `rootLoading`, `selectedRef`, `currentEntryId`, and `readerError`.

## Composition and action ownership

A composite owns its outer request and privately prepares children from captured parent data. It does not assign child `sref` or trigger child source.

Ten child renderings from one captured response require one outer request and zero child requests.

A parent that owns a child data-changing action prevents the child default and emits one parent semantic action. The current unprevented owner executes once. Presentation-only controls remain local.

## Reader session

`@sefaria/web-components/reader-session` is a supported advanced DOM-free semantic/raw facade over immutable Reader navigation.

It owns stable entry and operation identities, selected source position, presentation, exact capture coverage, completion eligibility, history, pins, transactional root replacement, bounded budgets, and raw transitions. Public `entryInfo`, `sourceRecord`, and `connectionsRecord` access plus `ReaderEntryInfo`, `ReaderSourceRecord`, and `ReaderConnectionsRecord` expose semantic identity, effective requests, documented statuses, coverage, and library-owned immutable raw payloads without exposing prepared child rendering or content.

Default retention is 20 entries and 20 MiB of aggregate uniquely retained corrected payload JSON. Durable persistence, Forward, browser URL history, retries, coalescing, stale fallback, and public arbitrary pane management remain outside the contract.

## Reader element

Reader owns ordinary source and links source, source qualification, semantic history, Back, breadcrumbs, local captured-links reprojection, responsive pane presentation, cancellation, stale suppression, private preparation, and error reporting.

The `toolbar-actions` slot is additive. The public parts are `toolbar`, `history`, `source-pane`, and `connections-pane`; child parts are not forwarded.

## Component contracts

### Text Segment

Renders one selected version, direction, safe markup, and footnotes. `vocalizationMode` is presentation-only. Standalone requests use `return_format=default`.

### Bilingual Segment

Resolves primary and translation roles independently from payload evidence. `contentLanguage`, `layout`, `sideOrder`, and `vocalizationMode` are presentation-only. One missing side is partial; two missing sides are empty.

### Source Card

Owns one bounded text collection, heading, aligned role pairs, attribution, positional identity, and optional selection. Scalar, range, spanning, and nested non-spanning responses share one element. `sefaria-source-select` reports the canonical target and original position. The heading renders the payload's canonical English `ref` and Hebrew `heRef` through a private template with `lang` and `dir` on each part; it makes no request beyond the card's own text request and exposes no nested element, link, or event.

The former alpha Reference Label element (`<sefaria-ref-label>`, the `./ref-label` subpath, `sefaria-ref-label-error`, and the `resolveReference` data loader member) is removed. Hosts that need a citation link write an ordinary anchor to `https://www.sefaria.org/<url_ref>`; hosts that need text with its heading use Source Card.

### Connections Panel

Owns grouped connections, stable ordering, bounded 20-entry UI pages, and captured preview states. Category, page, and preview visibility changes over captured data make zero requests. Selection and paging events are composed and keyboard reachable.

### Reader

Owns one source-and-connections workspace plus retained semantic history. Reader actions include Back, breadcrumb activation, pane changes, source selection, connections category/page/selection, preview requests, and explicit chat export.

## Text, direction, and attribution

API HTML passes through `@sefaria/text-transform` exactly once before private prepared content reaches rendering. Direction and attribution come from payload data. A validated absolute HTTP(S) source may render as a link; arbitrary source strings do not.

## Accessibility and theming

Elements use open shadow roots, real interactive controls, visible focus, accessible names, semantic status/alert output, keyboard operation, and shared `--sefaria-*` theme properties. Reader exposes only its documented slot and coarse parts.

Every element paints its host with `--sefaria-surface`, which defaults to a tinted surface, except Text Segment. Text Segment defaults to a transparent background so a single passage reads as page text; an explicit `--sefaria-surface`, set on the element or inherited from an ancestor, still tints it. Inside a composite, Text Segment stays transparent unless the host sets the token, so the parent's surface shows through.

## Verification

Required tests cover:

- supplied-data zero-I/O and invalid-data supersession
- standalone loading for all five elements
- shared versus explicit source
- original failure causes and no unhandled rejections
- stale completion suppression
- disconnect/reconnect behavior
- supplied/acquired private-preparation equivalence
- Reader loader admission and semantic/raw record boundaries
- exact one-parent/zero-child request counts, including ten-child cases
- generated metadata and supported-export staleness

## Completion criteria

This component cutover is complete when the implemented declarations, generated metadata, examples, specifications, and deterministic tests agree on the boundaries above. Broader compatibility coverage remains separately planned.
