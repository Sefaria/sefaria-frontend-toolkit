# Evidence

## Unified Text Segment language selection

**Maintainer decision on October 8, 2026:** replace Text Segment's mutually exclusive strict-language and preferred-translation inputs outright in the next alpha. The maintainer then chose the simpler name `language`, rather than `version-language`, for the unified input. One optional `language` selects either original or translated text; omission retains primary selection. Full language-family names remain the transport vocabulary. Exact edition and fallback policy remain independent inputs. This supersedes the Text Segment split recorded under preferred translation selection below, not the translation-side preference on two-sided components.

**Source observation on October 8, 2026:** `text-segment-element.ts` exposes both language properties and rejects their combination; `text-segment.ts` duplicates the distinction in its selection union. The shared preferred-translation helper rejects source editions, which is appropriate for two-sided translation selection but not for one arbitrary selected segment. Unified segment preparation instead matches family evidence regardless of source role, while retaining primary evidence for the omitted-language case. No transport correction, client policy, or upstream behavior change is required.

**Version decision on October 8, 2026:** the maintainer requested the `0.1.1` alpha line for this change. The installed Changesets CLI consumed the note and generated synchronized changelogs and dependent private-workspace updates. Its default next version was `0.1.0-alpha.1`; the installed npm version command then set the three private library manifests to the explicitly requested `0.1.1-alpha.0`, and the newly generated changelog headings and dependency entries were aligned with that target. Prerelease mode remains `alpha`, internal dependencies remain `workspace:*`, and no package publication or source tag was created.

**Historical version-policy regression on October 8, 2026:** the integration-policy check admitted planned install guidance only for the literal initial version `0.1.0-alpha.0`, rejecting the same qualified wording for `0.1.1-alpha.0`. The feature branch initially supplied its client manifest version to permit explicitly pending guidance. The subsequent npm-launch documentation established `scripts/npm-documentation-release.json` as the independent published recommendation owner and replaced that prepublication policy. During integration, published recommendations remain `0.1.0-alpha.0`, source manifests remain `0.1.1-alpha.0`, and the obsolete planned-install policy is removed rather than creating a second recommendation authority. New-language candidate examples use the candidate build's local modules; production promotion must qualify the selected runtime against its release artifacts.

## Conditional post-launch documentation

**Documentation scope on October 8, 2026:** this isolated branch prepares finished-state consumer guidance for public npm `0.1.0-alpha.0`, the public `v0.1.0-alpha.0` GitHub Release and version-pinned jsDelivr/UNPKG delivery. It starts from release-engineering source `2d9cade6cc5b517d1ee4189e3a8d6e636cacde90`. Consumer wording describes the assumed completed launch; it is not publication evidence.

**Reported handoff, not independently reverified here:** [preparation run 37450586664](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/actions/runs/37450586664) passed the guard, Windows/Linux preparation, platform-byte comparison and draft upload; publication, verification and finalization were skipped. The handoff identifies [the draft](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/releases/tag/untagged-a5c5c2451cb65324ac36), with three tarballs, `release-manifest.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt` and `MAINTAINER-COMMANDS.ps1` downloaded and validated using production `readHandoff` against the exact source/version. The user reports administrators completed the requested setup. Neither report establishes actual npm publication, native approval execution, trusted publishing or CDN availability.

**Original rollout condition (superseded for consumer documentation):** merge and deploy this documentation only after all three exact npm records, internal dependencies, integrity and anonymous installed consumers verify; the same complete GitHub Release is finalized and publicly downloadable; and all three modules and their notices match the captured assets on both jsDelivr and UNPKG with MIME/CORS and real Chromium, Firefox and WebKit imports. Run the read-only hosted commands in [Development](development.md#numbered-npm-releases) against the original downloaded release assets, not assets rebuilt from this documentation branch. Qualify the resulting website after deployment, including its pinned sandbox examples.

Switching new-page recommendations does not retire Pages delivery. Catalog entries, retained archive bytes, original licenses and restoration remain untouched. Any operational retirement or removal of Pages-only assembly requires a separately authorized change. Historical run-numbered script versions, including `0.0.0-alpha.37286368389.1`, are not npm version `0.1.0-alpha.0`. Later trusted publishing remains a distinct qualification gate; first publication does not prove it.

**Local documentation qualification:** `pnpm setup:agent`, `pnpm reference:generate`, `pnpm prose:check`, the four focused documentation/policy test files (93 tests), and `pnpm test:site` passed on Windows. Earlier complete attempts exposed corrected browser-copy assertions and intermittent failures in unchanged native-navigation, heavy-lock recovery and VS Code layout tests; their combined focused rerun passed all 18 tests. The complete production gate subsequently passed all 20 stages with `$env:VITEST_MAX_WORKERS='4'; pnpm check`, bounding local Vitest concurrency on the shared Windows machine without changing assertions, tests or timeouts. This includes real packed files, manifests, browser/framework consumers, reference freshness and site acceptance, not live registry proof.

**Original-asset CDN qualification on October 8, 2026:** this session copied the original six release assets unchanged and validated them through production `readHandoff` against `0.1.0-alpha.0` and source `2d9cade6cc5b517d1ee4189e3a8d6e636cacde90`. Production `verifyCdnFiles` passed for both jsDelivr and UNPKG, including exact browser-file hashes, MIME and CORS. Production `testPackageBrowserModules` with `live: true` then passed actual Chromium, Firefox and WebKit imports on both providers, including live Micah requests, supplied-data rendering, opaque-origin use and duplicate evaluation. These tests used the original published bytes, not packages rebuilt from this documentation branch. The local log is `.artifacts/npm-cdn-browser-live.log`; direct local npm registry qualification remains TLS-blocked, so this is not a locally passed complete `verifyHostedCdn` run.

**Hosted qualification on October 8, 2026:** a read-only GitHub job-status query independently confirmed [verify-finalize run 37801614474](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/actions/runs/37801614474) passed guard, draft capture and verification, with preparation and publication skipped and finalization waiting. The coordinating session reports that verification included exact npm integrity and anonymous installed consumers, and that finalization requires the designated `engineering-sefaria` native environment approval, which the current account cannot grant. At this observation, the rollout condition still required public release completion and explicit preview acceptance before merge. No npm assets were rebuilt, repacked or republished for this documentation update.

**Preview feedback and final local qualification on October 8, 2026:** Avi requested removing Hackathon origin only from the license/status page, compact installation instructions beneath each landing tab, and one authoritative recommended-version input. `scripts/npm-documentation-release.json` now owns that recommendation, separately from unpublished source-manifest versions. Existing reference generation/checking synchronizes consumer files while historical evidence, administrative commands and initial-version specifications remain immutable. Automated review identified a maintenance stamp leaking into copyable HTML. Avi approved the narrow correction: raw HTML now anchors version synchronization to its real CDN import, with no stamp in consumer code or generated `llms.txt`. Claude, Grok and Gemini cleared the corrected followup. This is automated review, not human code review or final preview acceptance. Three focused files passed 50 tests; the revised complete `$env:VITEST_MAX_WORKERS='4'; pnpm check` passed all 20 stages. Chromium also verified the refreshed stable preview's three install/link routes, corrected license page and metadata-free assistant prompt at a 390-pixel viewport.

**Clarified landing layout and sequencing on October 8, 2026:** Avi clarified that the three library cards, not the interactive demo tabs, should name their packages. The corrected landing keeps one global toolkit description and one shared components quick-install area with npm/CDN controls. The library cards name their corresponding packages on separate lines, and the demo tabs retain their original behavior without repeated install blocks. A real browser reproduced missing toggle styling because the borrowed rules were component-scoped. Avi approved moving only the existing shared choice/button rules to the theme stylesheet. Browser regressions prove button separation, visible selection, keyboard focus and Enter activation. Claude, Grok and Gemini cleared the correction; the complete bounded-concurrency `pnpm check` passed all 20 stages, 125 files and 1,154 tests. The refreshed hydrated preview passed at 1,280 and 390 pixels. Final user acceptance remains pending. Avi subsequently selected separate PRs with the documentation promotion gate merged before this documentation branch, so neither preview acceptance nor this local qualification alone authorizes a documentation merge or Pages update.

**Superseding preview decision on October 9, 2026:** Avi directed removal of the entire hero install block while giving its design more thought. The block, npm/CDN selector, activation flag and unused component/styles are removed; the three named library cards and original demo tabs remain. The existing snippet runner's choice styles return unchanged to their original component scope. The coordinating session relayed explicit visual acceptance conditional on this removal, not permission to bypass gate-first integration, release finalization or clean CI. The refreshed preview proves the block and selector absent and the retained cards/demo tabs working at 1,280 and 390 pixels. A failing regression preceded removal; nine focused tests and all 20 bounded-concurrency `pnpm check` stages passed. Claude, Grok and Gemini cleared the narrow removal review. This records visual feedback and automated qualification, not human code review.

**Superseding consumer-delivery decision:** Avi clarified that this documentation uses the already-published npm packages, not a new version or release, and that GitHub Release and self-hosted CDN guidance should be removed from consumer documentation. The root README, landing/install pages and generated references now direct consumers to npm and exact-version jsDelivr/UNPKG modules. Public GitHub Release finalization is no longer a prerequisite for documenting the already-qualified npm/CDN version. The internal draft-asset handoff and finalization workflow remain unchanged; retained Pages archives, licenses, catalog and restoration are untouched. Promotion/deployment sequencing is a separate coordination decision, not evidence that another npm publication is needed.

## Documentation promotion artifact paths

**Observed October 13, 2026:** [Pages run 38375591221, attempt 2](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/actions/runs/38375591221/attempts/2) failed before upload while waiting for module scripts in the selected editor. A local production-path build of `8923307b18112a9308a9d6b82e71169c513f38b2`, pinned to `0.1.0-alpha.0` under `/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/`, reproduced the failure without replacing CDN modules. The discovered `across-components/choose-what-text-readers-see.html` route renders a Mermaid diagram above its editor asynchronously. That layout change moved the editor below the viewport after the controller's one-shot scroll and before lazy activation. The iframe stayed `about:blank` with no `srcdoc`; scrolling again activated the unchanged editor. A later wait could also time out after activation: Chromium suppresses animation-frame polling in an offscreen iframe. Delaying the actual CDN module until after scrolling away reproduced that timeout despite an already registered constructor; clock-based polling passed immediately. The controller now tracks the viewport until activation and polls runtime readiness on a clock, retaining the existing timeouts, scripts-only sandbox, attached-module, height-report, custom-element and exact-CDN-request checks. The serial three-engine built-site regression delays actual hydration bytes, shifts preceding layout, then delays the ordinary offline suite's real local browser bundle until the iframe is offscreen. The pre-hydration case failed with the original one-shot activation in all three engines. These are smoke-driver corrections, not package, rendering-contract or deployment-policy changes; production acceptance still uses actual pinned CDN bytes without substitution.

**Historical inspection on October 8, 2026:** raw `LiveEditor.vue` and `SourceCardSnippet.vue` `srcdoc`, the then-Pages-alpha runner import map and local module substitution exposed a real consumer-path mismatch. That source used Pages run `37448450012` and deployment `6881371849` at `2d9cade6cc5b517d1ee4189e3a8d6e636cacde90`. It is not the current bootstrap. After the separately authorized docs-first rollout, fresh provider reads confirmed successful deployment `6958943207`, Pages run `37920138687`, at `47226ba0d4cb5ac8b018829e987376deaee6ea09`. The docs session reported actual three-browser npm/CDN proof against the original `0.1.0-alpha.0` artifacts and an unchanged archive catalog; the gate independently checked the deployed source/run and local original runtime/distribution equality.

The maintainer selected one `release/docs` published branch plus `main` for next-release code and documentation. The maintainer separately selected a public original GitHub handoff as a future prerequisite. Finalization remains separate, without draft-reading write permission. This decision does not undo the approved docs-first deployment. Local candidate sandbox and import-map tests passed Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit without replacing module bytes. Branch setup, protections, and hosted promotion remain planned. This implementation ran no branch, release, archive, or deployment operation.

On October 11, 2026, the maintainer replaced the merge-forward ancestry rule with corrections on main first and reviewed cherry-picks to `release/docs`. Conflict edits can adapt the correction to the published version. The reviewed [release-branch guidance](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-for-release/) recommends fixes on the development branch first, then cherry-picks to the release branch. GitHub's [Pages guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages) supplies the build, upload, deployment, and environment mechanisms. These mechanisms do not establish npm/CDN compatibility or preserve a correction's meaning.

The old gate rejected a valid cherry-pick because the next main source did not contain the release branch's correction commit. A temporary Git repository reproduced that failure before the implementation changed. The revised gate requires the selected release branch tip, not shared correction history. Before upload, it also makes sure that the successful deployment still matches the run selected at resolution. Review and tests own correction meaning on each branch. The earlier promise that ancestry proves correction inclusion is superseded.

## npm-only release engineering

**Maintainer decision on October 6, 2026:** the approved plan supersedes the GitHub Packages and automatic main-build publishing decisions recorded below. The engineering slice prepares synchronized public npm releases through one manual caller and one draft GitHub Release containing actual npm package assets. The initial authorized Sefaria maintainer uses their own npm account and 2FA; Avi needs no npm membership or manual transfer. Existing Pages restoration and archives remain intact until a separately qualified and authorized CDN cutover.

**Observed locally on October 6, 2026:** the installed Changesets 3.0.2 CLI applied the actual pending inputs from main SHA `0d11376df384f7bd9b5321146a1ebd95f6f3668b`, producing `0.1.0-alpha.0` for exactly the three synchronized libraries. Source manifests remain private with workspace resolution. The CLI moves consumed prerelease prose into `.changeset/pre`, creates changelogs, and stores prerelease mode/tag in `pre.json`. The committed source-stamped fixture preserves the original input bytes for offline initial-version proof without historical Git objects. Synthetic later-alpha/stable rehearsal is separate evidence, not the initial-version authority.

Fresh reads of GitHub's [environment REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/environments) and [environment protection guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/deployments-and-environments), and npm's [trusted publishing guidance](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers), support the separated release permissions, reviewed environment and later exact-caller OIDC contract. npm documents trusted publishing on supported GitHub-hosted runners with npm 11.5.1 or newer and Node 22.14.0 or newer; that setup remains externally owned.

**Read-only provider observation on October 6, 2026:** `npm-release` exists with an `engineering-sefaria` required reviewer and a selected `main` branch rule, and reports `prevent_self_review: false` and `can_admins_bypass: true`. During implementation Avi explicitly directed adoption of all three discussed simplifications: allow self-review, allow normal administrator bypass, and remove the per-run protection-configuration API guard in favor of native GitHub approval. This supersedes the stricter rules in the earlier plan. The observed settings match that revised setup intent, but actual approval execution remains unqualified. This engineering task made no configuration changes. npm organization ownership, initial publisher access, trusted publishing and actual npm/CDN availability remain unqualified.

Local tarball qualification exercises real npm staging, exact internal dependencies and public target, all three browser modules in Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, opaque-origin imports, duplicate evaluation, and vanilla/React/Alpine package consumers. Local fixtures and automated tests are not proof of hosted publication, environment approval, npm access or final deployed website qualification. The later cutover remains planned.

Automated review identified that GitHub's [List releases API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#list-releases) exposes drafts only with push access. Avi explicitly approved moving GET-only capture into the existing `contents: write` draft-assets job, before native approval, without elevating the npm publisher. Ordinary CI qualification also now permits pending Changesets, while real release preparation still requires consumed notes. These are regression-backed engineering corrections, not hosted rollout evidence.

**Local qualification on October 6, 2026:** after those corrections, `pnpm check` passed all 20 stages on Windows, including 123 test files and 1,120 tests, actual private/public tarball consumers, reproducible package/manifest bytes, all three browser engines, framework consumers, site acceptance and installed-CLI alpha/stable transitions. Claude, Grok and Gemini cleared the corrected pre-publication diff. This is automated review, not human review. No workflow dispatch, draft upload, package publication, configuration change or Pages retirement was performed. The engineering machine has no direct npm access; hosted registry/CDN qualification belongs on an accessible runner and remains pending.

**Boundary regressions on October 6, 2026:** real authored tar archives reproduced acceptance of 4,001 entries, uncaught exceptions rather than promised rejection for unsafe entries, and Windows normalization hiding a raw backslash path. The inspector now rejects the 4,001st entry, checks the raw header path, and aborts its parser through a managed stream pipeline before extraction. Tests cover the valid 4,000-entry boundary, traversal, duplicate paths, symbolic/hard links, expanded-size rejection, streamed byte limits with missing or understated length, and original network/abort failures. The OIDC publisher's workspace and pinned npm installs now disable lifecycle scripts; policy mutations reject removal of either flag. These are offline regressions, not hosted release or trusted-publisher qualification.

## Sefaria ownership migration

**Maintainer decision on October 5, 2026:** Avi Levin confirmed Sefaria ownership, Sefaria clearance to adopt MIT, the package names `@sefaria/api-client`, `@sefaria/text-transform`, and `@sefaria/web-components`, and `sefaria-api-client.js` for new browser releases. The project remains experimental and community-driven with Sefaria backing and support. Preserve the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2026 origin. This records the user's authorization, not an independent legal review.

Fresh provider reads found the repository under `Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit`, the Sefaria Pages site and alpha manifest responding with HTTP 200, and the old personal Pages site and sampled browser-module URL responding with 404. The maintainer chose the Sefaria host only, superseding the earlier old-host preservation promise. Historical archived bytes and licenses remain unchanged. The proposed package pages returned anonymous 404, which does not distinguish missing from private packages; authenticated organization package listing was unavailable because the local token lacked `read:packages`.

The account had repository Write access and organization Member status, not Admin or Owner. Hosted bootstrap, package visibility/access, and the new release opt-in require separately authorized rollout. GitHub's current [npm registry documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry) supports workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` publication but requires consumer authentication. Its [transfer documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#about-repository-transfers) says granular npm package ownership does not follow repository transfer. Earlier publication observations below describe the former scope, not qualification of the new names.

**Local qualification on October 5, 2026:** `pnpm check` passed all 20 stages on Windows, including 121 test files and 1,103 tests, documentation and script-source browser acceptance, compatibility qualification, actual tarball consumers, and synchronized Changesets rehearsals. Extracted package browser modules passed separate-origin import and supplied-data rendering in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, with one client request and zero component requests. Mixed-schema restoration preserved the schema-2 client filename and historical license bytes. The final lockfile change contains only workspace package-identity updates.

Claude and Grok automated reviews reported no significant defects. Gemini exceeded the bounded review wait and was omitted from this round. This is local qualification and automated review, not human review or hosted publication. In particular, the repository token's authenticated organization-package listing remains unqualified under Sefaria policy; an authorization failure stops bootstrap rather than being treated as an empty inventory. No npm publication, package-visibility change, release-variable change, or retained-archive mutation was performed.

**Maintainer decision on October 1, 2026:** Avi Levin directed removal of Reader raw seed functionality and Connections Panel public `data`; mutable components use a custom `SefariaDataLoader` that may serve local corrected payloads for supported refs and fail or delegate for unsupported refs. Text Segment, Bilingual Segment, and Source Card remain the only public elements with authoritative `data`.

## Distribution simplification qualification

**Local qualification on October 5, 2026:** the package browser build produces the standalone modules once. Script-source assembly consumes those exact bytes and private fingerprint/dependency evidence, rejecting missing, incomplete, invalid, or stale evidence rather than rebuilding. Regressions verify zero bundler calls during normal assembly and byte equality for all three entries. The optional `pnpm build:script-source --compare` still passed its explicit split-module comparison.

CI and bootstrap now call the same read-only validation workflow and mode-tagged publisher. GitHub's freshly read [reusable-workflow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows) confirms that local workflow references resolve to the caller's commit, Boolean inputs are typed, outputs require workflow-level forwarding, and callees cannot elevate the caller's permissions. The publisher owns the single non-cancelable publication queue, while both callers retain fail-closed validation aggregation and their distinct activation gates. Bootstrap remains necessary until namespace activation; authenticated GitHub Packages does not replace anonymous Pages delivery or historical archive restoration.

The combined migration and simplification passed all 20 `pnpm check` stages in an isolated checkout on Windows, including 122 test files and 1,110 tests, real tarball consumers, script-source and documentation browser acceptance, compatibility, and Changesets rehearsals. An earlier run reached the documentation browser gate but failed during Firefox context cleanup with a browser protocol error; the unchanged retry passed.

Automated review identified that standalone site builds cleared package browser files before reading the evidence. The actual forced build and a new plan regression both reproduced the failure. Standalone builds now invoke the existing browser producer once after library compilation; prebuilt site assembly still invokes no producer. The regression, `pnpm build:site --force`, and the final full check passed. Claude, Grok, and Gemini reported no significant issues in the final automated review. This does not constitute human review. The maintainer's identity-only review stash was not applied to the review working copy. These results qualify the combined tree, not that intentionally incomplete review copy or hosted workflow authorization.

## Preferred translation selection

**Observed September 27, 2026:** Sefaria's freshly read [documentation index](https://developers.sefaria.org/llms.txt) and [v3 texts reference](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/get-v3-texts) document full language-family names, `language|versionTitle`, repeated `version` parameters, reserved role selectors, and warnings for missing selections. They do not define an ordered language-fallback parameter. The [pinned handler](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/api/views.py) turns missing selectors into keyed warnings; the [response builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text_request_adapter.py) selects versions by family or role, de-duplicates them, and returns available-edition metadata. [Upstream API tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/api/tests.py) cover repeated selectors, exact editions, absent language/translation, and optional same-language gap filling.

Fresh deployed probes with `version=primary&version=french&version=english&return_format=default` returned French editions for Micah 6:8 (Bible du Rabbinat 1899 [fr]) and Pirkei Avot 1:1 (Maximes des Pères, trans. by Rabbi Rivon Krygier, 2023 [fr]). Berakhot 2a:1 returned English and a `french` warning with code 102. French versions reported `actualLanguage: "fr"` and `languageFamilyName: "french"` despite legacy `language: "en"`. Separate default-primary/default-translation probes returned no French availability metadata for Berakhot and primary-only content with no-translation warning 104 for Shuvi Shuvi HaShulamit. These are API probes, not website UI verification.

The [current website selection implementation](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/a417ae2a0c6431f0b01cd8812c53f78177bf3d24/static/js/sefaria/sefaria.js) checks edition preferences and available-version metadata before requesting one translation. It can fall back to the reserved `translation` selector and enables same-language gap filling. The toolkit preference instead extends its existing direct v3 requests with one missing-language fallback; it does not copy the website's saved preferences, metadata source, or gap-filling policy. The user selected Sefaria's default translation rather than guaranteed English and explicitly retained empty preferred editions.

The [dated selection captures](../packages/web-components/test/fixtures/translation-preference-2026-09-27.json) preserve four freshly fetched responses and their exact URLs: French Micah, missing-French Berakhot, Berakhot's default translation, and Shuvi Shuvi HaShulamit without any translation. Every capture passed the existing corrected `validateGetV3Texts200` validator before storage. Browser regressions use these captures for French attribution, the two-request fallback, and supplied/acquired equivalence. Empty editions, reordered candidates, contradictory metadata, and aborted requests are separately identified authored variations, not additional deployed observations. No OpenAPI correction was required.

**Local qualification on September 27, 2026:** `pnpm check` passed all 18 stages, including 107 test files and 923 tests. The built Source Card explorer additionally passed a narrow-viewport browser journey in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit: no requests before activation, French Micah with `lang="fr"` and actual-edition attribution, two-request Berakhot fallback, zero requests for visible-side changes, and one strict missing-edition request without fallback. Three automated reviewers cleared the final changes after regression-backed fixes for invalid Reader selections leaving stale requests active, connections-only seeds losing the preferred family, and seeded navigation losing interrupted fallback progress. This is local qualification, not a hosted publication or human code review.

This document records source observations that support the design and specifications. It does not define product behavior or delivery status.

## Host-owned preview decision

**Observed September 27, 2026:** at `1ca16880ac4d8413971915d63f615c674b69d77c`, Popup combines Source Card preparation with an anchored dialog shell and a private 20-position truncation. Its preparation has no non-Popup consumer. The approved alpha API removal instead assigns modal presentation to the linked-article host and uses ordinary Source Card rendering, with no retained Popup-only limit. The owning component and integration specifications define the replacement; older Popup observations below remain historical evidence.

Fresh hosted manifest reads found identical alpha and `0.0.0-alpha.36313907924.1` metadata reporting 402,492 raw bytes and 108,059 gzip bytes. This confirms the prior "first hosted publication pending" statement is stale, not that a new hosted browser qualification was run. The retained P5 pin must keep its original Popup implementation; new builds may remove it.

**Local P8 qualification on September 27, 2026:** the unchanged baseline and six-element replacement were built with the same installed dependencies and compression settings. The final minified module measured **390,469 raw bytes and 106,618 gzip bytes**, reductions of 12,023 and 1,441 bytes respectively. `pnpm check` passed every stage, including 105 test files and 883 tests, the six-project editor, six-element metadata, and packed-consumer rejection of the removed subpath. Production linked-article journeys passed in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit at both root and project URL bases. They exercised modal Source Card rendering, Enter activation, Escape/button close, originating-link focus return, narrow layout, and one new cache-disabled request per opening.

Native dialog keyboard behavior can yield focus to browser chrome while the page remains inert; the smoke distinguishes that from focus escaping into background page content. WebKit's default link-tab policy skips ordinary links, so its journey focuses the authored link before real Enter activation; Chromium and Firefox additionally traverse to it with Tab. The deterministic browser suite covers modifier/default preservation, supersession, ignored aborts, errors, cleanup, and ordinary content beyond the removed 20-position limit. Review identified a padded-reference error-identity mismatch, reproduced with a failing test and corrected by trimming the authored reference before assignment. All three reviewers cleared the follow-up. No hosted publication or retained-pin mutation was performed.

## Browser script distribution observations

**Observed September 26, 2026:** the pre-P5 distribution specification excluded CDN distribution, while the Pages assembler removed and rebuilt `dist/site` and the deployment replaced the complete site. Preserving published script paths therefore requires restoring archived bytes on every deployment rather than rebuilding only the current version. This observation motivates the separate browser script contract; it does not change the authenticated GitHub Packages transport.

A production Vite 8.2.2 build of the existing package-root exports produced one self-contained ES module of **402,492 raw bytes and 108,059 gzip bytes** (Node gzip level 9). A comparison build with per-element entries and shared chunks totaled **403,750 raw bytes and 119,542 gzip bytes**; its Source Card closure required eight files totaling **314,391 raw bytes and 93,841 gzip bytes**. These are measurements of the unchanged library implementation at `422f98add7d42a51afd0f52cc8fccd253d63e916` with the new script build recipe, not fixed size limits or a claim about Pages response encoding. The selected all-elements entry favors a single-file installation contract. `pnpm build:script-source --compare` regenerates the report.

The same production recipe at `054470450fbfe6001ad84ff2e5b3a222b07bf820` also measured the data and text-tool modules: `sefaria-client.js` was **184,662 raw bytes and 40,502 gzip bytes**, and `sefaria-text-transform.js` was **80,301 raw bytes and 33,953 gzip bytes**. The measurement is over Vite 8.2.2 minified output with Node gzip level 9. In Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, both modules imported inside a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` `srcdoc` iframe, with no import map. The client's text request from that iframe carried `Origin: null`. These are measurements, not size limits.

The actual bundled dependency inventory is `@hey-api/client-fetch` 0.13.1 (MIT), `@lit/reactive-element` 2.1.2 (BSD-3-Clause), `domelementtype` 3.0.0 (BSD-2-Clause), `domhandler` 6.0.0 (BSD-2-Clause), `entities` 8.0.0 (BSD-2-Clause), `htmlparser2` 12.0.0 (MIT), `lit` 3.3.3 (BSD-3-Clause), `lit-element` 4.2.2 (BSD-3-Clause), `lit-html` 3.3.3 (BSD-3-Clause), `lru-cache` 11.5.2 (BlueOak-1.0.0), and `zod` 4.4.3 (MIT). Initial assumptions that all non-Lit dependencies use MIT were incorrect. The build copies full package notices rather than substituting assumed licenses.

Local production-artifact acceptance rendered Micah 6:8 on separate-origin plain HTML in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, including duplicate module evaluation, one-request ten-item composition, supplied/acquired visible-text equivalence, and malformed-response error state. Archive-backed tests restored distinct releases across deployments without changing older bytes and removed only explicitly retired versions. Hosted release/publication and Pages availability remain unqualified.

**Observed September 27, 2026:** the same unmodified production module also passed keyboard and pointer interaction journeys in all three browsers at root and project-path URLs. Source Card selection reached a document-level host listener and updated selected positions; language/vocalization controls changed and restored visible content without resource. Reader category selection opened Rashi on Micah 6:8:1, narrow-screen controls switched panes, and Back restored the initial selection, with exactly five outer requests for the complete journey. Popup open/close/reopen preserved one source, emitted document-observable close events, and restored anchor focus. A temporary copy with the Source Card selection event deliberately renamed still rendered but failed the host-selection assertion; its manifest hashes and size were recalculated, proving the failure came from the interaction test rather than integrity validation. The temporary artifact was removed.

GitHub's [repository-renaming documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository), read September 25, 2026, explicitly excludes project-site URLs from automatic redirects. The retained-location obligation in the distribution specification does not rely on such redirects.

GitHub's [Pages limits](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/github-pages-limits), read September 26, 2026, cap published sites at 1 GB. Keeping each version's corresponding-source archive on Pages makes retained releases the dominant growth term. The implementation checks a conservative 1,000,000,000-byte whole-site budget and reports cleanup candidates without automatically retiring any version. The installed Octokit Fetch transport consumes an abort signal rather than a `request.timeout` field; a focused SDK-level regression verifies a fresh effective deadline on successive requests.

## Upstream documentation coverage

**Observed on September 6, 2026:** Sefaria's [Formatting within Sefaria Texts](https://developers.sefaria.org/docs/text-formatting-beyond-the-segment-level) already explains subsegment markup and lists allowed tags and attributes. The review establishes current coverage, not when each topic was first published.

| Already explained upstream | What this repository adds |
| --- | --- |
| Markup belongs to a Version's text rather than an Index; ordinary inline formatting and line breaks | A guide connecting those concepts to validated payloads, factories, and component rendering |
| Footnote marker/body pairs and inline commentary placements, including matching link metadata and label overrides | Local extraction behavior, missing versus empty bodies, inert metadata, and component ownership |
| Structural overlays, direction spans, reference-link attributes, and images | The exact local allowlist, URL restrictions, alt-text-only image handling, and explicit deferred behavior |
| A table of the persisted tag families and supported attributes | Additional pinned source/fixture observations and a distinction between persisted, API-generated, Web-generated, legacy, and hostile input |

Do not describe these upstream explanations as undocumented discoveries. Our [markup guide](concepts/clean-text-and-safety.md) is a companion explaining examples and local handling. The [differences guide](concepts/sefarias-own-texts-and-tools.md) identifies deliberate local choices; an implementation detail found in source is not automatically either undocumented or a local divergence.

Further research starts from Sefaria's [current documentation index](https://developers.sefaria.org/llms.txt), which identifies guides and API reference pages and advertises Markdown page variants. Refetch the relevant pages before relying on coverage claims. The review above does not establish coverage or absence for every edge case, such as exact PASEQ policies, parser recovery, or data-dependent response shapes.

Current explanatory documentation does not replace the pinned source, upstream tests, deployed fixtures, or guarded overlay required for a transport correction. Historical observations below remain dated evidence; they are not claims about what today's documentation omits.

## Exported text-markup inventory

**Observed on September 20, 2026:** Sefaria's public MongoDB export was downloaded from the official export location and inspected directly with MongoDB Database Tools 100.18.0; no MongoDB server was required. The downloaded `dump_small.tar.gz` was 2,557,911,131 bytes with MD5 `696dbaaf1b4d0127e5eabe6ce4073b20`, and the small and full dump URLs returned byte-identical files at capture time.

The complete `texts.bson` scan covered 11,718 version documents and 5,171,560 string leaves. Root text values comprised 9,460 list roots and 2,258 object roots. Three unexpected boolean `false` leaves occurred in one Midrash Aggadah version; this storage observation does not relax the corrected API text contract or justify coercion.

All 13 tags in Sefaria's official formatting table occurred in stored text. Representative lexical counts were `b` 4,064,782; `i` 1,950,652; `small` 906,282; `br` 598,418; `sup` 545,501; `span` 146,216; `big` 131,563; `a` 39,124; `u` 2,012; and `sub` 395. Reviewed class counts included `i.footnote` 535,419; `sup.footnote-marker` 535,071; `a.refLink` 32,765; `i.instruction` 8,064; `span.poetry` 29,556; and `span.indentAll` 25,771.

The persisted `poetry` and `indentAll` occurrences correct the earlier local characterization that poetry classes were solely Web-generated. Their presence is evidence that old or imported text can store them; it does not make them part of the normalized output grammar. Other undocumented or unreviewed class families are reported by qualification and stripped while safe children remain unless a specification change admits them.

The scan also found malformed markup and reviewed obsolete tags in real stored text. This supports standards-parser recovery, explicit `big` normalization, iterative traversal, unsupported-attribute removal, and a bounded synchronous output policy rather than source-string rewriting.

## Commentary link evidence

**Observed on September 20, 2026:** validated link records for `Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayim 1:1` map inline Magen Avraham order `1` to `Magen Avraham 1:1`, order `2` to `Magen Avraham 1:2`, and order `3` to `Magen Avraham 1:3`. The links response builder exposes the requested endpoint as `anchorRef` and the opposite endpoint as `sourceRef`; `inline_reference` remains unknown-valued in the generated contract and therefore requires field guards before projection.

This evidence supports an explicit request-free projection helper rather than reference inference from marker labels or URLs. Exact base-reference and selected-edition scoping occurs before the transform receives narrow `{ commentator, order?, label?, ref }` candidates. Missing, malformed, ambiguous, or conflicting evidence does not add `data-sefaria-ref`.

## Source baseline

The research used:

- `Sefaria/Sefaria-Project` at `c33ee50`
- later web spot checks at `4c0ecc1`
- `Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile` at `925420d`
- `Sefaria/sefaria-mcp` at `d409602`
- the live `sefaria.org` DOM and computed styles in August 2026
- the live `/api/texts`, `/api/v3/texts`, and `/api/powered-by` endpoints
- live probes of each relevant `return_format`
- [`Sefaria/Sefaria-Project` `docs/openAPI.json` at `1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/docs/openAPI.json)
- the deployed Linker on a third-party page
- `DaveDushi/bisl-torah` at `ea51f7b`
- `jleznek/torah-chat` at `1492fc5`

Evidence has these classes:

- **Observed:** Source code or a live result supplied the fact.
- **Inferred:** Public consumer behavior supplied the likely rule.
- **Proposed:** This project defines the behavior.

## Declarative standalone-loading cutover

**Observed September 22, 2026:** the coordinated cutover removed the supported public prepared-view-model, owner-controller, binding, and Reader-controller surfaces. It did not retire `./reader-session`: that subpath remains the supported advanced DOM-free semantic/raw facade for history, pins, budgets, `entryInfo`, stable source/connections raw records, and raw transitions without prepared content. The `./reader` subpath exposes shared raw source qualification. All seven registered elements now accept standalone `sref`. The six non-Reader elements accept authoritative component-specific raw `data`; Reader accepts raw source/connections seeds transactionally. Generated metadata records public read-only status and Reader diagnostics, component-specific error events, tagged source, and the retained Reader slot/parts.

Focused browser and unit coverage exercises supplied-data precedence, invalid-data supersession, lazy shared versus explicit source, original failure causes, stale-result suppression, disconnection/reconnection, Popup preparation independent of visibility, Reader local loader admission and semantic records, and parent-owned composition. Source Card and Connections regressions prove one outer request and zero child requests, including ten-child cases. Maintained live pages retain explicit activation gates, and MCP continuation remains host-proxied without direct browser fallback.

**Observed September 23, 2026:** a maintained-example attribute audit found that scalar inputs were still assigned through property bridges even though generated metadata exposes attributes. Converting optional exact-edition selectors to attributes exposed a Lit boundary mismatch: removing an optional string attribute produced `null`, while component request builders correctly modeled absence as `undefined`; switching a pending bilingual request from exact editions to default editions therefore failed before the second source. A shared optional-string converter now restores `undefined` on removal, and default-preserving scalar metadata restores required defaults such as empty `sref`; focused coverage proves both transitions. Maintained ordinary browser examples activate through `sref` attributes plus optional property-only source, supplied fixtures remain zero-request `data` properties, and MCP or parent-owned composites remain the explicit raw-data bridge cases. Default-true booleans remain property exceptions when a host must express false.

## Repository contract-document corrections

**Observed September 8, 2026:** the component specification's connections row used `ConnectionsPanelRequest`, `ConnectionsPanelViewModel`, `createConnectionsPanelViewModel`, and `loadConnectionsPanelViewModel`, while the implemented and exported declarations in `packages/web-components/src/connections-panel.ts` use `ConnectionsRequest`, `ConnectionsViewModel`, `createConnectionsViewModel`, and `loadConnectionsViewModel`. The specification table was corrected to the existing public declarations; production exports were not renamed to match the stale documentation.

**Observed September 17, 2026:** the six endpoint-backed component modules had materially different owner signatures that ruled out a public universal loader descriptor. Text segment, bilingual segment, source card, and popup used request/client/signal operations; reference labels also required deterministic `RefLabelFactoryOptions`; connections required a projection and its existing VM-only async factory discarded the corrected links payload needed for local category/page reprojection. The implemented owner controllers therefore share only the private mechanics in `packages/web-components/src/component-controller.ts`. Each owner module retains its fixed generated operation, request validation, status handling, options, and pure projection, while `packages/web-components/src/connections-panel.ts` alone retains one current immutable links capture.

**Observed September 17, 2026:** focused controller and browser tests exercised all six supplied-data and live lifecycles, original transport-error identity, ignored-abort supersession, external abort reasons, invalid input before supersession, subscriber failures, reentrant calls, RefLabel option stability, status-200 unresolved/API-error outcomes, Connections zero-request reprojection and capture disposal, duplicate/unbound bindings, post-dispatch cancellation, and stale event origins. The registration-free `packages/web-components/src/bindings.ts` used type-only element imports; its Node import test observed zero registered custom elements. Maintained vanilla, React, explorer, linked-article, Reader, and MCP consumers import controller adapters from the new `./bindings` subpath rather than a package-root Reader binder.

**Observed September 30, 2026:** Source Card's heading was the only production consumer of `<sefaria-ref-label>`. It assigned a prepared label built from the Source Card's own `/api/v3/texts/{tref}` `ref` and `heRef` fields, left `sref` empty, and never used the label's `/api/ref/{tref}` source, `linked` URL, or error event; `resolveReference` had no caller other than the label and the explorer's pending-state stub. The alpha element, subpath, event, and loader member were therefore removed, and the heading became a private Source Card template. The Source Card browser test that asserts the English and Hebrew heading parts, their `lang`/`dir`, wrapping, and zero requests replaces the label-specific coverage; the September 17 observations above describe the pre-removal module set.

The specifications own proposed behavior. This document records observed and inferred evidence.

The Sefaria web and mobile repositories are the primary evidence for current rendering behavior. Live Sefaria surfaces supplement those repositories.

Consumer projects show integration needs and independent use. They do not define Sefaria behavior.

On August 30, 2026, Sefaria's remote `master` was `91ca8c1a32a6f883261862933ecb394dc1025c1e`. The files used for the text-markup and transform analysis had not changed since the pinned `1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6` revision.

## TypeScript 7 toolchain qualification

**Observed on September 8, 2026:** the clean `9a3789dc6655a508bde1eafb731fcac0a262fc13` baseline passed the complete repository and Pages-bundle checks with TypeScript 6.0.3 and ESLint 10.9.0. Its ESLint stage took 35.5 seconds on the qualification Windows machine.

Oxlint 1.80.0 reproduced the tested native recommended-rule behavior, `consistent-type-imports`, explicit-`any`, JavaScript undefined-name, duplicate-parameter, and legacy-octal failures. Five independent native-only Windows runs over the complete candidate tree completed successfully in 0.58 to 0.84 seconds. These measurements describe one machine and source snapshot; they are not a cross-platform performance guarantee.

Running `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` 62.9.0 through Oxlint's JavaScript-plugin compatibility layer reproduced seven of eight customized declaration diagnostics. It did not visit an undocumented property of an exported class, including after equivalent selector rewrites. The implemented fallback therefore removes the JavaScript plugin and parses fresh TypeScript 7 declaration output. The qualification output contained 44 declaration files and 196,672 bytes, including client scripts and each package source tree.

TypeScript 7.0.2 completed the workspace typecheck, all workspace builds, and the focused compatibility qualification. A clean dependency resolution showed that `@hey-api/openapi-ts` 0.99.0 crashes when it resolves TypeScript 7 directly because `ts.SyntaxKind` is unavailable. The client package now pins TypeScript 6.0.3 for that generator dependency, while its build and typecheck scripts explicitly invoke the workspace-root TypeScript 7 compiler. The offline OpenAPI check passes across that isolated boundary. This evidence supports the repository toolchain migration; it does not change any Sefaria product contract or establish compatibility for other TypeScript tools.

An ephemeral Debian Linux environment with Node 22.23.2 and pnpm 11.22.0 completed a frozen-lockfile installation, native Oxlint, offline OpenAPI generation, the TypeScript 7 workspace typecheck, declaration-documentation validation, the 17 focused migration regression tests, and every workspace build. The lockfile initially retained private package-proxy tarball URLs after clean resolution; removing those redundant URLs preserved integrity-based resolution and passed the repository supply-chain verifier on both Windows and Linux. Full Linux Chromium and Python acceptance remain delegated to the ordinary CI workflow rather than this toolchain-specific qualification.

## Package-foundation qualification

**Observed on September 14, 2026 with Node 26.8.1 and pnpm 11.22.0 on Windows:** after removing the known library, example, demo, and compatibility build outputs, a frozen-lockfile install followed by the normal `pnpm check` completed every repository stage. Workspace builds ran before TypeScript consumers and declaration checks, so the result did not depend on pre-existing library `dist` directories. The final test run discovered 79 files and passed 589 tests; all 73 files in the pre-move baseline inventory remained present at their mapped paths. During the move, a temporary failing test under `examples/explorer` was discovered and failed before removal, proving the new selector rather than only comparing filenames.

The package smoke packed the three unchanged private library tarballs, validated their manifests, 18 public export targets, file allowlists, exact rewritten internal versions, and retained private flags, then installed them into an isolated Vite consumer using explicit `file:` overrides for every toolkit dependency. The resulting lockfile and installed real paths contained no toolkit workspace or registry resolution. After the tarballs were removed, Node imported the client, transform, factory, reader, controller, and session paths without DOM registration, and Chromium rendered the deterministic Micah 6:8 source-card flow. Two consecutive smoke runs passed, including clean preview shutdown between runs.

The generated metadata qualification covered seven registered elements and all 18 package subpaths. The Lit analyzer supplied declaration metadata; the bounded repository adapter rejected placeholder dynamic event names, validated literal event and shared CSS-token catalogs against source, and recorded the current absence of public slots and CSS parts. Generated JSON and Markdown passed stale-generation and formatting checks.

**Observed September 17, 2026 at customization commit `786c9481f6224715cda00776d354c460e81f5c0a`, integrated with Reader-root checkpoint `cfed9b25785a604411a8f1b26708e6e8319be5b5` as `c11b7067c46c7958650c4ddfad41f6c4caf19ef0`:** the controlled Reader exposes one additive `toolbar-actions` slot and the four coarse `toolbar`, `history`, `source-pane`, and `connections-pane` parts. The maintained website example reads the selected target from the current controller snapshot when its page-local bookmark action activates, disables that action while source or connections work is loading, and makes no bookmark request. Template metadata verification resolves supported Lit HTML/SVG imports through named and namespace aliases, handles quoted and unquoted literal attributes, rejects dynamic or unresolved markup tags, and fails when source declarations and template slot/part/export forwarding evidence differ in either direction. The integrated serial `pnpm check` passed all 17 stages, including 92 test files with 740 tests, seven registered elements, all 19 package subpaths, compatibility qualification, tarball consumers, and Chromium smokes.

Changesets 3.0.2 accepted the configured fixed group containing exactly the three libraries with private versioning enabled and private tagging disabled. In an external disposable Git fixture starting at `0.1.0`, the rehearsal observed synchronized `0.1.1-alpha.0` then `0.1.1-alpha.1` versions, updated internal dependencies and changelogs, retained private flags, and created no tags or automatic commits. This is local unpublished package qualification, not publication or official Sefaria adoption.

## Integrated-toolkit qualification

**Observed on September 14, 2026 with Node 26.8.1 and pnpm 11.22.0 on Windows:** the qualification started from toolkit commit `598662766e9b572a579eebda783f6de17409e109`. After removing the enumerated dependency and build-output directories, no library or example `dist` output remained. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` used the machine-configured package proxy, and the normal `pnpm check` then completed without Python, VS Code authentication, a live Sefaria request, a producer-source alias, or prebuilt package output.

The normal check discovered 83 test files and passed 610 tests. Its package smoke inspected all 18 private package exports, installed the actual vanilla and React tarballs into isolated consumers, deleted the source tarballs before runtime, resolved both top-level and UI-parent-relative dependencies from the installed packages, proved Node-safe subpaths and browser registration, and completed the Chromium interaction paths. The deterministic MCP qualification retained the official Apps 1.7.5 and SDK 1.30.0 Node protocols, Inspector discovery, separate host and sandbox origins, exact request stages, and desktop and narrow geometry checks.

The immutable test-disposition gate compared the 73-file baseline inventory at `7bc2d258fac2959beb5252ebdbcbddbaccd0c7b7` and the pre-retirement showcase at `d7e2d59645ebf7427dcff2cbdd78073e2e7df58c`. It classified 64 baseline tests as retained and verified that Vitest actually discovered every maintained destination. Nine baseline tests have explicit presentation-only or superseded dispositions; useful source, factory, React, Reader, selection, history, supplied, partial, empty, and error behavior remains mapped to executable maintained tests.

The cold run exposed a stale TypeScript incremental-state failure in the MCP example: deleting `examples/mcp-app/dist` left `tsconfig.server.tsbuildinfo` outside the output tree, so a later server build could skip emission of `dist/server/stdio.js`. The server build metadata now lives at `dist/server/.tsbuildinfo`, and site assembly consumes the complete MCP package build rather than redirecting its Vite output. A cold MCP build, site assembly, and official Inspector `tools/list` all succeeded after the correction.

Independent GitHub-flavored Markdown rendering with repository context displayed the current toolkit-branch root README, documentation index, supplied-data lesson, live-interaction lesson, React lesson, Reader lesson, and customization lesson. The rendered HTML exposed the essential install/build commands, fenced source examples, and maintained next-step links. A separate deterministic parity gate validates inline links, reference definitions, HTML anchors, and the maintained lesson journey, including negative broken-file and broken-anchor mutations; CI does not depend on external GitHub availability.

The production documentation-site gate served the built site on an operating-system-assigned port and verified the served identity before navigation. It exercised supplied data with zero requests, one explicit public-client fixture request, a real source selection, Reader connection and breadcrumb navigation, display-only changes with no additional requests, source-file navigation, narrow and iframe geometry, and deterministic keyboard focus or activation for the landing page, source card, Reader, linked popup, and static live MCP host.

**Read-only repository policy observation on September 14, 2026:** `main` remained the default branch at `7bc2d258fac2959beb5252ebdbcbddbaccd0c7b7`. Both `main` and `feature/avilevin/frontend-toolkit-alpha` required the strict `check` status from GitHub App ID 15368, pull-request review, conversation resolution, administrator enforcement, and disabled force-push and deletion. Pages remained workflow-based with source `main:/`; the `github-pages` environment used a custom branch allowlist containing only `main`, not every protected branch. Private vulnerability reporting was disabled. No repository setting or deployment was changed during qualification.

The authenticated VS Code and live Sefaria walkthroughs remain optional named-host evidence recorded elsewhere in this document. They were not repeated or converted into deterministic CI requirements, and the qualification does not establish publication, deployment, official Sefaria ownership, or future host compatibility.

## Copilot agent readiness qualification

**Observed on September 15, 2026 with Node 26.8.1 and pnpm 11.22.0 on Windows:** `pnpm setup:agent` completed a frozen workspace install, verified the immutable Git objects used by the test-disposition gate, installed the existing Playwright Chromium release, and launched and closed Chromium. A disposable three-commit repository cloned with `--depth 1` proved that the shared history-preparation function obtains explicitly required older commits and verifies them after fetch.

The complete `pnpm check` then passed all 16 stages. Vitest discovered 84 test files and passed 618 tests, including the new setup, shared detector, workflow-policy, check-result, and real shallow-checkout regressions. The machine-readable result identified every stage as passed. This local run does not establish hosted Linux or Windows Actions behavior.

An occupied-port probe held `127.0.0.1:6338` while a maintained browser test started. Vitest reported that the configured port was in use, selected another port, and passed all 10 selected tests. The demonstrated implementation already supports this collision; no custom port allocation was added.

The conditional `copilot-setup-steps` workflow is repository source until separately bootstrapped on the default branch. Actual GitHub-hosted checkout selection and conditional execution remain unverified and must not be described as active cloud-agent behavior before real sessions on `main`, the toolkit integration branch, and a toolkit-derived branch supply evidence.

## Fresh-history repository qualification

**Observed on September 15, 2026 with Node 26.8.1 and pnpm 11.22.0 on Windows:** the public `Arithmomaniac/sefaria-frontend-toolkit` repository began with one root commit whose tree hash exactly matched `Arithmomaniac/sefaria-web-components@b6fec1c9293ffd4bdbf1505fed65b0d41f1d0fcb`. The replacement repository did not contain the historical commits used by the earlier test-disposition implementation. Its committed 73-file baseline and 9-file showcase inventories were compared exactly with the corresponding trees at `7bc2d258fac2959beb5252ebdbcbddbaccd0c7b7` and `d7e2d59645ebf7427dcff2cbdd78073e2e7df58c` before the source repository was detached.

The disposition gate retained its exact count, retirement-reason, destination-existence, and Vitest-discovery checks while reading only repository-local inventory data. Agent setup no longer invokes Git, and CI no longer requests full history. The complete `pnpm check` passed all stages with 84 test files and 618 tests while both historical commit objects remained absent from the replacement repository. A separate one-commit depth-1 clone then completed `pnpm setup:agent` and the disposition gate with both predecessor objects still absent.

## Personal package identity qualification

**Observed on September 15, 2026 with Node 26.8.1 and pnpm 11.22.0 on Windows:** the three private library manifests, workspace consumers, source imports, generated public-export metadata, Changesets fixed group, agent detector, documentation, and package-policy tests used `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-client`, `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-text-transform`, and `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-web-components`. Package metadata pointed to `Arithmomaniac/sefaria-frontend-toolkit`, and maintained source links targeted `main`; immutable predecessor links remained attached to the predecessor repository.

The complete `pnpm check` passed all stages with 84 test files and 618 tests. The tarball qualification packed `arithmomaniac-sefaria-client-0.0.0.tgz`, `arithmomaniac-sefaria-text-transform-0.0.0.tgz`, and `arithmomaniac-sefaria-web-components-0.0.0.tgz`, installed all three into isolated vanilla and React consumers, resolved every public and transitive import from the installed packages, and completed both Chromium smokes. The Changesets rehearsal retained synchronized private prereleases under the new names.

## Static browser MCP feasibility probes

**Observed on September 16, 2026 with the repository-pinned MCP TypeScript SDK 1.30.0, MCP Apps SDK 1.7.5, Vite 8.2.2, and Playwright Chromium on Windows:** an ephemeral Vite bundle imported `Client`, `McpServer`, `InMemoryTransport`, and `registerAppTool`, connected one client/server pair in Chromium, listed the registered tool, and called it successfully. No repository source or build output was written by the probe. This establishes browser bundling and a basic in-memory protocol exchange; it is not proof of the packaged Sefaria App, resource, AppBridge, continuation, cancellation, or cleanup path.

The same browser session fetched bounded `Micah 6:8` reference, v3 text, and text-inclusive links URLs from localhost and after navigating to the deployed `https://arithmomaniac.github.io` Pages origin. Each response was readable CORS JSON with HTTP 200. This is dated endpoint-availability evidence, not a replacement for corrected response validation or a guarantee that future upstream CORS policy remains unchanged.

A self-contained `data:` outer iframe with `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` reported an opaque `null` message origin, could not read its parent document, and could populate an inner iframe document. This established a candidate same-site deployment primitive with a distinct opaque origin; it did not by itself prove source-window validation, fixed policy enforcement, the packaged-App handshake, or App isolation.

**Qualified later on September 16, 2026:** the production browser host connected the real pinned MCP client and registered server with `InMemoryTransport`, read the byte-identical packaged App through `resources/read`, and rendered it through AppBridge and PostMessageTransport in the opaque proxy. Deterministic Chromium acceptance observed zero Sefaria requests before activation, then exactly one `get_text` request and one App-mediated `get_links_between_texts` continuation. Separate tests proved bounded App initialization failure and close-during-start cancellation without a Sefaria request. MCP typecheck, build, eight protocol tests, three browser-host tests, official stdio Inspector qualification, the existing deterministic Streamable HTTP/AppBridge demo, and the assembled documentation-site acceptance passed. These results qualify the static reference host; they do not replace external named-host, stdio, or Streamable HTTP evidence.

## Supplied-data editor qualification

**Observed on September 17, 2026 with Vite 8.2.2, Playwright 1.63.0, Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit on Windows:** a child-only CSP probe was initially interpreted as an architectural blocker because a sandboxed opaque frame could assign its own location. That evidence was incomplete and is superseded. The deployed-equivalent editor host adds a leading parent CSP meta with `frame-src data:` and `child-src data:`. With that parent policy and the child policy together, both same-origin and external self-navigation produced zero destination-server requests in all three engines; Chromium replaced the blocked child with its internal error document while Firefox and WebKit retained the original opaque document.

The production editor build was qualified at `/` and `/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/`, directly and when embedded from an ordinary same-origin documentation page. Its real Rollup graph contained shared generated chunks mapped to local data modules. In each engine, importing the pure source-card subpath did not register the element, the client root and validation subpath exposed the same `getResponseContract` function identity, the required seven-project public factory, controller, session, and binding entries loaded, and importing the web-components root registered the same `SefariaSourceCard` constructor exactly once. The maintained reference-label, text-segment, bilingual-segment, source-card, popup, connections-panel, and Reader projects rendered with no external requests or page errors.

The same acceptance sent fetch, beacon, WebSocket, image, nested-frame, and navigation attempts to a separately counted loopback probe server. The probe server received zero requests. Focused tests also proved visible edits to every HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file, Reset restoration, one supported interaction per project, exact Reader coverage rejection without replacement content, popup Escape focus restoration, payload-owned RTL/LTR output, draft isolation until Run, one active preview, keyboard tab selection, narrow 200%-equivalent layout, exact source/asset/message/diagnostic/preview bounds, and visible runtime/import/CSP diagnostics. The shared dated Micah links fixture records the full 194-entry, 1,371,603-byte response provenance and retains a deterministic 22-entry, 33,762-byte subset sufficient for categories, paging, and previews. This is browser confinement evidence, not CPU, heap, process isolation, every-Safari compatibility, or guaranteed recovery from a tight loop.

## Private GitHub Packages publication qualification

**Observed on September 15, 2026 in GitHub Actions:** PR #3 merged as `ff8665446cfda95657dd88499cd11cc03f2bb3d9`. Main run `34985975150`, attempt 1, published synchronized version `0.0.0-alpha.34985975150.1` for all three packages and then failed its anonymity check because GitHub had created the package records public despite the staged manifests and publish commands specifying restricted access. After the three existing package records were manually changed to private in GitHub's package settings, the unauthenticated linked package pages returned `404`.

Attempt 2 published `0.0.0-alpha.34985975150.2`; authenticated registry metadata and anonymity checks passed, and an isolated pnpm consumer installed all three exact versions. Verification then exposed two consumer-harness defects: pnpm records a peer-context suffix on an exact resolved version, and a project-level token-reference `.npmrc` is ignored. PR #4 merged the corrective verifier as `69bc17c14bae8a16584b31f021d93054f51fb6cf`.

Main run `34989378311` passed hosted Ubuntu and Windows validation, the fail-closed aggregate, publication, and complete registry-consumer verification at synchronized version `0.0.0-alpha.34989378311.1`. The verifier confirmed authenticated registry metadata and repository linkage, anonymous package-page `404` responses, exact isolated installation, lockfile provenance, installed manifests and real paths, and every Node-safe public import. These observations establish that restricted publish metadata does not bootstrap private visibility for a new package identity. Existing package visibility persists independently in GitHub configuration, so publication must check that state before exposing another immutable version.

**Locally qualified on September 15, 2026:** the preflight implementation read each package through an authenticated registry request, checked each linked package page without authentication, validated each record's existing `alpha` version and exact repository/dependency metadata, and placed the command after the current-main check but before the first publish. The package records may start with different valid `alpha` versions, allowing a later run to repair a publication that stopped between package publishes without weakening the existence, privacy, or linkage gates. Focused publication and workflow-policy tests passed 13 tests. The complete `pnpm check` passed all 16 stages with 85 test files and 626 tests. This local result does not prove repository-token access or live workflow ordering; a successful hosted `main` publication remains required for that evidence.

## Public GitHub Packages publication qualification

**Observed on September 20, 2026:** PR #18 merged as `e8cebeaa6fc3b6b2e8d5746d92493fd2ecb13093`. The three existing package records were changed from private to public through their owner settings, after which their canonical unauthenticated package pages each returned HTTP 200 and displayed their existing version histories. The repository rollout variable `PUBLIC_PACKAGES_ENABLED` was then set to `true`.

Main workflow run `35489617787`, attempt 2, passed Ubuntu and Windows validation, the fail-closed aggregate, the public-visibility preflight, all three ordered publishes, and complete registry-consumer verification. It published synchronized version `0.0.0-alpha.35489617787.2` for `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-client`, `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-text-transform`, and `@arithmomaniac/sefaria-web-components`. Each public package page exposed that exact version after the run. The verifier authenticated to registry metadata, confirmed repository linkage and exact internal dependencies, installed all three versions into an isolated consumer with no workspace, link, file, or tarball resolution, and imported every Node-safe public subpath.

This qualifies public GitHub Packages distribution and the automatic green-`main` alpha path. GitHub still requires authentication to install public npm-format packages. The package names remain experimental and subject to change, and the packages are not published on npmjs.com or a CDN.

## Historical decision provenance

This section records the strongest session-history decisions that explain the current contract boundaries. It does not define product behavior; the current specifications and design document do that.

### Declarative standalone-loading redesign (September 22, 2026)

**Superseded planning record:** this September 20 design approval preceded the implemented cutover recorded above. It remains provenance for the chosen boundary, not current delivery status.

The earlier owner-only/request-free element decision is superseded. Its code and tests are historical baseline evidence. The redesign does not supersede the thin-client transport boundary, generated response validation, bounded per-client cache, text-transform ownership, one-parent-request/zero-child-request composition rule, Reader history/capture constraints, MCP host-proxied transport, or maintained live-page activation gates.

The reviewed Sefaria Web source shows a hybrid rather than universal ownership rule: larger text/Reader owners can load by reference, smaller rendering children receive prepared data, and Linker popups receive text prepared before opening. This supports private captured-data composition and Popup preparation independent of visibility, but it is not authority for exposing public prepared state or restricting standalone loading to only large components.

The executable failure that motivated the redesign was a connected `<sefaria-text-segment sref="Micah 6:8">` that previously rendered nothing without caller orchestration. The September 22 observation records that this counterexample now passes through element-owned source and private preparation.

Session UUIDs with turn numbers and dates are archive trace pointers, not public links. Session archives can omit tool output and can contain assistant proposals or branch reports, so those reports are not implementation proof. The baseline for this audit is `origin/main` commit `7f631685961b3ff6243d812570e1ffbd85aa53c6`; September 6, 2026 active worktrees are excluded.

| Decision | Session evidence | Historical proposal or supersession | Current owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Corrected transport contracts instead of a generalized model | `de4d0659-4a18-4271-90d1-7114c1226581`, turn 4, August 28, 2026: the source card was a “red flag” and the OpenAPI document should generate the client types. Turn 5 rejected taking responsibility for generalized models. | The earlier `@sefaria/model` and private source-card foundation was superseded by the corrected OpenAPI and thin-client boundary. | [`design.md`](design.md), [`specs/client.md`](specs/client.md) |
| Request-free elements and factory-owned projection | `de4d0659-4a18-4271-90d1-7114c1226581`, turns 43-44, August 31 and September 1, 2026: payload-to-view-model orchestration should sit between the payload and the component. | The historical assistant description is a proposal or branch report; it does not prove that every planned integration is delivered. | [`design.md`](design.md), [`specs/components.md`](specs/components.md) |
| One bounded source-card collection | `a7049088-19ac-4308-8662-7a384026dfb2`, turns 14, 23, and 24, September 4-5, 2026: a segment can be a singleton collection, the reference appears once, and attribution belongs once in the card container. | The separate text-range request and view-model stack is superseded by the source-card collection projection. | [`specs/components.md`](specs/components.md), [`development.md`](development.md) |
| Removal of the offline-model foundation | `cdb4a0e1-1089-4ddc-ad33-2b925c7d5a87`, turn 37, August 26, 2026: the user explored client-owned cross-section expansion and questioned `RangeTopology` without an offline consumer. That discussion still contemplated local arithmetic splitting. `de4d0659-4a18-4271-90d1-7114c1226581`, turn 5, August 28, 2026, later rejected responsibility for generalized models. | The current no-offline-parser boundary is the later specification's resolution, not a verbatim instruction from the earlier range discussion. Default cache, retry, and coalescing policies are also excluded by the current client contract; the range discussion alone does not establish that exclusion. | [`design.md`](design.md), [`specs/client.md`](specs/client.md) |
| Representative, non-exhaustive qualification | `cdb4a0e1-1089-4ddc-ad33-2b925c7d5a87`, turn 4, August 25, 2026: the user distinguished a minimum viable implementation from exhaustive edge-case coverage and questioned how an oracle would be obtained. `590ea2de-a4f5-435d-9f49-14291fa2d9de`, turns 3 and 6, September 1, 2026, requested a higher-level explanation and critique of the approach; the detailed corpus and result-class proposal was assistant analysis, not a quoted user directive. | The current documented qualification uses a small source-backed suite and distinguishes unavailable evidence and intentional differences. Broader corpus comparison remains planned. | [`specs/client.md`](specs/client.md), [`specs/text-processing.md`](specs/text-processing.md), [`development.md`](development.md) |
| API-shaped MCP payloads replace the private wire format | `84986099-e42b-4f8c-91d5-30a576a8b6ea`, turn 5, August 2, 2026, proposed a source-card MCP payload and serializable reader state. `de4d0659-4a18-4271-90d1-7114c1226581`, turn 4, August 28, 2026, rejected putting that payload in a foundational model. | The private `SourceCardData` format is superseded. Corrected API-shaped JSON, boundary validation, and the same pure factory were the planned replacement and are now the current MCP behavior. | [`specs/integrations.md`](specs/integrations.md), [`development.md`](development.md) |
| Historical sources retain chronology and supersession | `84986099-e42b-4f8c-91d5-30a576a8b6ea`, turn 2, July 31, 2026, asked that the older detailed spec and shared spec be compared. `45fcf6a8-e726-4dea-99e2-af9fe0bc9f68`, turn 2, August 22, 2026, asked that spec-branch chronology be preserved. | Older proposals can explain a divergence, but are not a reason to restore behavior superseded by the current specifications. | This evidence record and the current documentation set |

Only task-relevant decisions are summarized here. The pointers retain traceability without publishing complete conversations, machine-local paths, or mutable delivery state.

## Reader navigation ownership (September 6, 2026)

**Observed in pinned source, not a new live-UI capture:** the navigation comparison uses Sefaria Web commit `05863b62ce0b7aa176b74df3bc8bfbdeb0bf171f` and Sefaria Mobile commit `77eb30f66ea71a0af6638c3b5c03a4624f68da8f`. These frontend observations do not replace the existing transport/OpenAPI pin.

**Local regression replay on September 17, 2026:** the existing validated [`examples/react-vite/src/micah-6-8.json`](../examples/react-vite/src/micah-6-8.json) payload established the canonical target `Micah 6:8`. A test-only, explicitly synthetic eight-row `Micah 6` context was derived from that payload by retaining its eighth text leaf and labeling the other seven leaves as synthetic. With client caching disabled, the pre-fix controller requested the alias target, canonical section, and then links for `Micah 6:1`; the corrected controller retains the initial response's server-qualified target and requests links for `Micah 6:8`. This is deterministic local regression evidence, not a deployed context capture.

**Local selection-integrity replay on September 17, 2026:** a current `Micah 6` entry paired position `Micah 6:8` with an informational event reference of `Micah 6:7`. Before correction, the session selected `Micah 6:8` while the controller requested links for `Micah 6:7`. The corrected controller resolves the current item by entry identity and position, requires reference agreement, and rejects the mismatch before changing state, cancelling an unrelated valid in-flight operation, notifying subscribers, or performing another request.

**Local transactional-root replay on September 17, 2026:** the controlled website began at validated `Micah 6:8`, retained that committed source while an external `Rashi on Micah 6:8:1` source request failed, and then replaced the root with validated `Micah 6:7` on the same controller and `<sefaria-reader>`. With client caching disabled, the log contained exactly the initial source and links requests, the failed replacement source request with no links request, and the successful replacement source and links requests. Pure session tests separately proved that a pinned root rejects replacement, released old pin and operation handles cannot identify new state, the successful root receives the next entry identity, and an over-budget candidate leaves the old session projection unchanged. These are deterministic local fixture-backed observations, not deployed Sefaria or hosted-browser evidence.

| Concern | Source observation |
| --- | --- |
| Web reader ownership | [`ReaderApp.jsx`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/05863b62ce0b7aa176b74df3bc8bfbdeb0bf171f/static/js/ReaderApp.jsx) owns `panels`, `setPanelState`, `makeHistoryState`, and browser `pushState`/`replaceState`. `openTextListAt` inserts or replaces a connections panel adjacent to its driving panel. `handleCitationClick` can close a following panel and insert a text panel through `openPanelAt`. |
| Web child state | [`ReaderPanel.jsx:127-136`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/05863b62ce0b7aa176b74df3bc8bfbdeb0bf171f/static/js/ReaderPanel.jsx#L127-L136) delegates changes to `setCentralState` when provided, otherwise using local state. Its connections header receives separate mode/category state and callbacks. |
| Breadcrumb presentation | [`BreadcrumbPath.jsx:41-120`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/05863b62ce0b7aa176b74df3bc8bfbdeb0bf171f/static/js/BreadcrumbPath.jsx#L41-L120) renders supplied crumbs and delegates caller behavior through `getCrumbLinkProps`. Its documented consumer is `SearchResultCard`; this is not evidence of a reader-history trail between connected sources. |
| Mobile history | [`PageHistory.js`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/77eb30f66ea71a0af6638c3b5c03a4624f68da8f/PageHistory.js) composes per-tab `PageHistory` in `TabHistory` and keeps current tab state separate from the back stack. [`ReaderApp.js`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/77eb30f66ea71a0af6638c3b5c03a4624f68da8f/ReaderApp.js) constructs that history, implements `manageBackMainOrOpenNav`, and passes the action to reader controls. |

The comparison distinguishes an open-panel collection, application history, category navigation, and breadcrumb presentation. It does not establish that Sefaria implements the proposed bounded source-to-commentary breadcrumb sequence. The [illustrated reader walkthrough](use-components/add-the-complete-reader.md) uses these observations as supporting evidence, not as authority for a new local contract.

**Observed September 7, 2026 during showcase acceptance:** at a 1440×900 browser viewport, the deployed supported Reader slide provided approximately 803 CSS pixels to the preview frame and 687 CSS pixels to `<sefaria-reader>`. The then-current 44rem/704px compact query therefore selected one-pane mode at normal zoom; reducing browser zoom to approximately 88% increased the effective CSS width enough to cross that threshold. Follow-up acceptance screenshots also exposed generic preview gutters, an outer page scroll around an unbounded Reader, and full toolbar rows reserved for each spatial pane's Close action. The deployed manual slide replaced one source/connections pair instead of demonstrating the repeating spatial source-to-connections cycle already implemented by `examples/reader`.

**Observed September 7, 2026 in the pinned Sefaria Web source:** [`ReaderApp.jsx`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/ReaderApp.jsx) uses `MIN_PANEL_WIDTH = 360`, a 68% text / 32% connections split for two panels, and 37% / 26% / 37% or 37% / 37% / 26% splits when three text/connections panels are present. Its segment and citation handlers open or update adjacent connections and source panels. A live Micah 6:8 inspection on the same date showed flatter separated text and connections surfaces rather than independent nested rounded cards. These observations support the local 68/32 wide layout and spatial-demo correction; they do not require pixel parity or move pane placement into the supported controller.

**Local baseline:** repository commit `5dedf0a89f9b8486143cc071e01b620cc53247cd` contains the connections demo, bounded client cache, and adaptive MCP source/connections App with explicit chat follow-up. The walkthrough's browser screenshot uses the demo's real host and components with committed text/links fixtures replacing HTTP responses; it is not live-service qualification. Its other new figures are labeled schematics/wireframes. The existing MCP screenshot retains the provenance recorded under [MCP host interaction](#mcp-host-interaction). The chat-composer flow is evidence of accepted `ui/message` delivery, not same-App server-tool navigation.

**External documentation reviewed September 6, 2026:** the [MCP Apps overview](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview) and [App SDK reference](https://apps.extensions.modelcontextprotocol.io/api/classes/app.App.html) describe host-proxied server-tool calls, tool-result notifications, and host-controlled capabilities. These support separating App-local navigation from server data access. They do not establish acceptance of connections navigation in this repository's named host.

**Observed September 7, 2026 in the isolated VS Code walkthrough host:** VS Code `1.136.1` with Copilot Chat `0.64.1` advertised the MCP Apps `serverTools` loader but supplied no `hostContext.toolInfo`. From the App opened by `get_text`, `App.callServerTool` successfully called both bare `get_text` and bare `get_links_between_texts`; each call returned its tool result directly to the same App instance. The probe used the staged self-contained App and live fixture server, then removed its temporary controls and instrumentation. This qualifies bare same-server tool names for this named host only. It does not establish behavior in hosts or gateways that rewrite tool names without routing bare App calls relative to the originating server.

**Accepted September 7, 2026 in the authenticated isolated VS Code walkthrough:** the final harness invoked only the initial `get_text` chat tool for Micah 6:8. One App frame then loaded connections through bare `get_links_between_texts`, navigated from Micah 6:8 to Agra DeKala, Balak 18 and then Exodus 15:15 through host-proxied controller operations, exported the deepest selected reference through explicit `ui/message`, activated the middle breadcrumb, and activated the root breadcrumb. The machine-readable result records `same-app-tool` for both connection hops and `host-message` only for explicit chat export. The Configure Tools picker initially exposed `sefaria-components-demo` as an unchecked group even though the MCP server had discovered both tools, so the harness enables that named group and disables Built-In tools before beginning the chat turn.

**Presentation recapture on September 7, 2026:** the same eight-stage walkthrough completed from a natural-language prompt with only the Sefaria tool group enabled. The current images and record use this run, labeled `showcase-capture`. Full-width Chat has no session-history subpane or sticky prompt; the Reader toolbar and the export composer remain visible at the configured zoom. Direct inspection showed that a Playwright viewport screenshot clipped this Electron surface to 1600 by 1000 pixels while native `Page.captureScreenshot` preserved all 1920 by 1200 pixels. The capture helper now uses the native surface and scrolls the virtualized Chat list rather than centering an oversized iframe. This is named-host capture evidence, not a guarantee about other hosts or future VS Code layouts.

The source audit establishes these constraints before overlay work:

- The v3 text response builder starts with `versions`, `missings`, `available_langs`, and `available_versions`. The handler removes `missings` and `available_langs` and adds `warnings`.
- The v3 text handler reads every `version` query value with `request.GET.getlist("version")`, so the generated request contract must permit a repeated parameter.
- The v3 text handler returns 404 for an invalid or empty reference. It returns 400 for an invalid `return_format` or an adapter failure.
- V3 text success fields include unconditional reference fields and conditional spanning, index, node, source, and linker fields. Required lists must follow the handler branches.
- The versions route names its parameter `tref`, and the tests pass `Genesis 1:1`. The OpenAPI path calls the same parameter `index`.
- The versions endpoint calls `Ref.version_list()`. A successful response is a list of version metadata. Book-level requests can add `firstSectionRef`.
- Live versions probes on August 30, 2026 returned `versionSource: null` for one Rashi on Genesis version and `status: null` for one Sefer HaChinukh version.
- A live invalid versions reference on August 30, 2026 returned HTTP 200 with a JSON `error` object through `catch_error_as_json`.
- The ref endpoint returns HTTP 200 with `{ "is_ref": false }` for expected parse failures. Successful fields depend on the node type and reference depth.
- The index endpoint delegates to `Index.contents()`. Query parameters can add content counts and related topics.
- `index_api` uses `catch_error_as_json`; an invalid title therefore returns an HTTP 200 JSON error object. A live invalid-title probe confirmed this branch on August 30, 2026.
- The shape endpoint returns a list for a text, complex text, corpus, or category. Each shape record uses lower-case `section`, `length`, `chapters`, and `book`, plus `heTitle`, `title`, and `heBook`.
- The shape collapse branch omits `title` and `heTitle` from aggregate complex-book records. The handler parses `dependents` with `bool(int(...))` and reads but does not use the deprecated `depth` value. A live Talmud shape probe on August 30, 2026 returned five collapsed records.
- The links endpoint defaults to `with_text=1`. A successful response is a list. Text and version fields can be strings, arrays, or null because merged and missing versions use different branches.
- The repeatable `category` query is read with `request.GET.getlist("category")`.
- When `with_sheet_links=1`, `format_sheet_as_link()` adds `isSheet`, `index_title`, `category`, `collectiveTitle`, `sourceRef`, and `sourceHeRef` to sheet results before appending them to the same response list.
- Essay links expose `displayedText` as an object with required `en` and `he` strings. Live Genesis 1:1 links on August 30, 2026 contained this branch.
- A live invalid links reference on August 30, 2026 returned HTTP 200 with a JSON `error` object.

Two documentation corrections also use the local Sefaria API audit as supporting evidence while retaining the pinned Sefaria implementation as authority:

- `Sefaria-API-audit/findings.yaml` finding `OAS-SCHEMA-009`, `Sefaria-API-audit/evidence/shape-matrix.md`, and `Sefaria-API-audit/proposed/openAPI.corrected.json` support wrapping both shape examples in the array root returned by the endpoint.
- `Sefaria-API-audit/findings.yaml` finding `OAS-DOC-001` and `Sefaria-API-audit/evidence/shape-matrix.md` support documenting the `SheetNode` navigation exception and the conditional `first_subref` and `last_subref` fields.

These source facts constrain the overlay. Deployed fixtures must still cover representative data-dependent branches.

The dated captures under `packages/client/test/fixtures` preserve the deployed v3 spanning-text, Genesis index, nullable version metadata, versions error, simple shape, shape error, Targum link, links error, Sheet reference, segment reference, same-section range, spanning range, commentary reference, and unresolvable-reference branches. `packages/client/test/fixtures/manifest.json` records the exact request URL and any reduction for each capture.

### September 3, 2026 reference captures

The unmodified deployed captures `ref-genesis-segment-2026-09-03.json`, `ref-genesis-range-2026-09-03.json`, `ref-genesis-spanning-2026-09-03.json`, `ref-rashi-commentary-2026-09-03.json`, and `ref-unresolved-2026-09-03.json` establish the payloads consumed by the current reference-label factory. They cover `Genesis 1:1`, `Genesis 1:1-3`, `Genesis 1:31-2:2`, `Rashi on Genesis 1:1:1`, and `__missing_ref_label_probe__`. The first four return `CoreRefSuccess`; the last returns HTTP 200 with `{ "is_ref": false }`.

The pinned [`RefView.dispatch`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/api/views.py#L93-L101) catches `InputError` and `DictionaryEntryNotFoundError` as `{ "is_ref": false }`, while other exceptions produce an HTTP 404 error payload. The empty and error reference-label states preserve that distinction.

The pinned [`Ref.he_normal`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L4739-L4748) delegates to `normal("he")`. [`Ref._get_normal`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L4683-L4691) falls back to `self.normal()` when the Hebrew full title is absent. A successful `hebrew` value therefore cannot distinguish a true Hebrew form from an English fallback without unsupported heuristics.

The pinned [`Ref.url`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L4780-L4801) replaces spaces with underscores, colons with periods, and question marks with `%3F`; it does not fully percent-encode a URL path. The reference-label factory preserves existing valid escapes and encodes remaining unsafe path characters before it creates an absolute URL.

### September 1, 2026 Genesis index capture

`packages/client/test/fixtures/index-genesis-2026-09-01.json` was captured from the deployed `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v2/index/Genesis` response on September 1, 2026. The committed fixture retains top-level `title` and `categories`; the root schema's `nodeType`, `depth`, `addressTypes`, `sectionNames`, `lengths`, `title`, `heTitle`, `heSectionNames`, and `key`; exactly the primary Hebrew and English root-schema titles; and only `alts.Parasha.nodes[0]`. That alternate node retains `nodeType`, `depth`, `wholeRef`, `addressTypes`, `sectionNames`, `refs`, reduced `match_templates`, `isMapReferenceable`, `sharedTitle`, all deployed titles in that node, `title`, and `heTitle`. All other top-level metadata and alternate nodes are omitted.

The September 1 capture is immutable. The current candidate-capture implementation requires exactly `--write --capture-date YYYY-MM-DD`, reads the source URL from this fixture's manifest declaration, refuses an invalid date or existing dated target before fetching, validates the unknown response with `validateGetIndexV2200`, applies the same deterministic reduction, and stages a newly dated candidate beside the fixture directory. It verifies the candidate target is still absent and publishes with one same-filesystem rename; it does not update the manifest, tests, or references. `packages/client/test/refresh-fixtures.test.ts` proves argument refusal, candidate naming, exact URL use, deterministic bytes, existing-target refusal, unchanged evidence on source or validation failures, successful creation, failed-publication behavior, and one-rename replacement semantics. Reviewers manually retain a candidate and update its provenance and references in a reviewed change.

## Current focused compatibility qualification

The current qualification is a small, pinned, offline suite. It is not an exhaustive comparison of Sefaria corpora, endpoints, versions, markup, or consumer code paths, and it does not claim broad compatibility publication. Broader corpus qualification remains planned.

### Criterion-to-proof map

| Issue #14 criterion | Existing and current proof |
| --- | --- |
| Eight Core operations with provenance | `packages/client/test/validation.test.ts` validates the dated v3, versions, ref, shape, links, find-refs, and async-task fixtures; `packages/client/test/payload-agreement.test.ts` proves the manifest covers all eight operations and validates the September 1 Genesis index fixture statically and at runtime. |
| Overlay scope and guarded preconditions | Existing `packages/client/test/generation.test.ts` cases prove extraction of only eight reviewed Core GET and POST operations, mutation failure at every co-located guard, deterministic offline generation, stale-output detection, and each reviewed correction. |
| Generated TypeScript and public validator agreement | Existing `packages/client/test/type-contract.test.ts` and `packages/client/test/validation.test.ts` cover generated public types and validators; `packages/client/test/payload-agreement.test.ts` adds shared accepted and rejected fixture expressions. |
| Negative required-field and old-shape fixtures | `packages/client/test/payload-agreement.test.ts` rejects an index response without required `categories` and the pre-overlay uppercase shape fields. Existing `packages/client/test/validation.test.ts` also enforces required, strict, and `minProperties` constraints. |
| Character and structural transform comparison | `packages/text-transform/test/vocalization.test.ts` and `normalize.test.ts` cover the pure operations. `tests/compatibility/src/index.test.ts`, `text-transform.test.ts`, and `cross-package-smoke.test.ts` add bounded code-point differences, pinned source comparisons, structural comparisons, and a full validate-to-transform path. |
| Explicit, reviewable capture | `packages/client/test/refresh-fixtures.test.ts` proves the Genesis-only network command requires exact write and capture-date arguments, creates only a new dated candidate, reduces deterministically, refuses existing targets, and leaves committed evidence unchanged on source, validation, or publication failure. |
| Evidence and parser interpretation preservation | This document remains the provenance record. `packages/text-transform/test/normalize.test.ts` characterizes standards-parser recovery without inventing malformed attributes; the focused qualification adds no alternate model or parser interpretation to supersede that result. |
| Separate result classes and no exhaustive claim | `tests/compatibility/src/qualification.test.ts` proves grouped `passed`, `failed`, `unavailable`, and `intentional-difference` output and nonzero exit only for unexpected failures. This section states the qualification's representative, non-exhaustive scope. |

### Composed v3 smoke fixture

`tests/compatibility/src/v3-source-backed.fixture.ts` is an intentionally composed fixture, not a verbatim deployed response. Its v3 field set and nesting follow the August 29, 2026 deployed `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Genesis%201%3A31-2%3A2` capture, while its citation-identifying metadata was authored as a non-spanning `Genesis 1:1` response for this focused case. Its single text string combines the MAM span `<span class="mam-kq-trivial">שְׁעָרָ֗ו</span>` hand-extracted from the August 30, 2026 Miqra according to the Masorah `Obadiah 1` response with the footnote marker, body, and nested bold text hand-extracted from the August 30, 2026 Contemporary Torah `Genesis 1:1` response; short connecting prose and punctuation make the two reviewed fragments one executable string. The fixture retains one `versions` record and only enough response metadata to exercise the generated v3 validator before one-pass normalization and HTML text-node vocalization. Because the metadata, fragments, and connecting prose are manually composed, refresh remains a manual source-review operation.

### Text-segment evidence reuse

The current text-segment tests reuse evidence that already supports the behavior under test rather than collecting another API capture. The composed v3 smoke fixture supplies a validated single-segment payload with mixed Hebrew and English text, retained vocalization, and a static footnote. `packages/client/test/fixtures/v3-text-spanning-2026-08-29.json` supplies a validated deployed array-valued response that proves the segment factory reports wrong granularity instead of silently choosing the first child.

Missing-version warnings, exact-version selection, ambiguous matches, `null`, blank content, invalid selectors, network rejection, and abort rejection are authored unit cases. They test the component contract directly and are not presented as deployed corpus evidence. The explorer's authored states are also view models for visual development; they are not API captures or independent behavior oracles.

### Executable PASEQ references

The compatibility input is exactly `א ׀ ב׀ג`.

| Reference implementation | Pinned source-derived policy | Expected output | Current executable comparison |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Sefaria Web `TextRange.jsx:263-278`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/TextRange.jsx#L263-L278) | Remove every PASEQ while preserving surrounding whitespace (`always`) | `א  בג` | `applyVocalization(..., { paseq: "always" })` matches. |
| [Sefaria Mobile `sefaria.js:1286-1292`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/925420dcf7dd00a16f8dc4c4191284792fc3f9fa/sefaria.js#L1286-L1292) | Remove PASEQ only after whitespace and remove that whitespace (`after-space`) | `א ב׀ג` | `applyVocalization(..., { paseq: "after-space" })` matches. |
| [Sefaria Linker `popup.js:308-319`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/linker.v3/popup.js#L308-L319) | Remove every PASEQ while preserving surrounding whitespace (`always`) | `א  בג` | `applyVocalization(..., { paseq: "always" })` matches. |

The current project default is `after-space`, so its output `א ב׀ג` intentionally differs from the Web reference output `א  בג`. The qualification labels that exact pair as `intentional-difference`; it is neither a pass nor an unexpected failure.

### Qualification result semantics

The current command emits one grouped count line and one detail line for every non-passing case. `passed` means the focused executable comparison matched. `failed` means an unexpected mismatch and produces exit code 1. `unavailable` means required pinned evidence could not be evaluated and remains visible but does not by itself produce a nonzero exit. `intentional-difference` means the exact documented project/reference divergence was reproduced and also does not by itself produce a nonzero exit. The current pinned suite expects `passed=9 failed=0 unavailable=0 intentional-difference=1`; this result qualifies only the named cases above.

## Text markup evidence

### Persisted text contract

Sefaria's persisted text contract permits `i`, `b`, `br`, `u`, `strong`, `em`, `big`, `small`, `img`, `sup`, `sub`, `span`, and `a`. It assigns attributes by tag: `sup[class]`; `span[class,dir]`; `i[data-overlay,data-value,data-commentator,data-order,class,data-label,dir]`; `img[src,alt]`; and `a[dir,class,href,data-ref,data-ven,data-vhe,data-scroll-link]`. The comments distinguish three uses of `i`: footnote bodies, commentary placements, and structural overlays. See [`sefaria/constants/model.py:1-12`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/constants/model.py#L1-L12).

`AbstractTextRecord` recursively passes string segments through Bleach with that tag and attribute contract. See [`sefaria/model/text.py:1068-1072`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L1068-L1072) and [`sefaria/model/text.py:1208-1217`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L1208-L1217).

Normal `TextChunk` writes sanitize text, but direct `Version` sanitation is deliberately empty. Legacy imports or direct Version writes can therefore retain markup outside the current persisted contract. See [`sefaria/model/text.py:1444-1448`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L1444-L1448) and [`sefaria/model/text.py:1918-1957`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L1918-L1957).

The persisted contract is evidence of legitimate source forms, not the reusable component's trust boundary. Arbitrary stored class values and URLs are too broad for HTML rendered on a third-party page.

### Markup taxonomy

| Family | Observed or source-defined form | Source status | Sefaria behavior | Project treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary emphasis | `b`, `strong`, content-bearing `i`, `em`, `u` | Persisted; selected live probes did not establish `u` | Rendered as native inline HTML | Preserve safe semantic tags |
| Size markup | `big`, `small` | Persisted; `small` is live-confirmed | Rendered as native inline HTML | Preserve safe semantic tags |
| Ordinary super/subscript | `sup`, `sub` | Persisted; selected live probes did not establish `sub` | Web delegates clicks from superscripts broadly | Preserve inertly; do not make every `sup` interactive |
| Line structure | `br` | Persisted and live-confirmed | Web uses breaks for text structure and layout | Preserve as canonical `br` |
| Footnote pair | `sup.footnote-marker` followed by `i.footnote` | Persisted, tested, and live-confirmed | Web hides the body and toggles it from the marker | Preserve through sanitation, then extract structurally |
| End-footnote marker | `sup.endFootnote` | Source-defined and recognized by stripping | Removed by `strip_itags` | Preserve as inert text until a component owns presentation |
| Rendered commentary marker | `sup.itag` | Web-generated and recognized by stripping | Produced from a selected commentary placement | Tolerate as inert text; do not infer source metadata |
| Commentary placement | Empty `i[data-commentator]` with `data-order` or `data-label` | Persisted, tested, migrated, and live-confirmed | Web replaces matching placements with `sup.itag`; `data-label` wins | Preserve reviewed attributes inertly |
| Structural overlay | Empty `i[data-overlay][data-value]` | Persisted and live-confirmed | CSS renders selected overlay names | Preserve safe values inertly without closing the value set |
| Direction wrapper | `span[dir]` and `i[dir]` | Persisted | Browser direction semantics | Preserve only `ltr`, `rtl`, or `auto` |
| Masorah paragraph marker | `span.mam-spi-pe`, `span.mam-spi-samekh` | Live-confirmed | Preserves paragraph or section notation | Preserve exact visible notation and map source classes to semantic MAM values |
| Masorah ketiv/qere | `span.mam-kq`, `span.mam-kq-k`, `span.mam-kq-q`, `span.mam-kq-trivial` | Live-confirmed | Preserves textual distinctions | Preserve text and nesting while mapping source classes to semantic MAM values |
| Reference link | `a[data-ref]` with optional `refLink`, `href`, version, range, and scroll metadata | Persisted attributes and API-generated/live forms | Web routes reference interaction from `data-ref` | Preserve only approved metadata and approved Sefaria URLs |
| Named-entity link | `a.namedEntityLink[data-slug][data-range]` | API-generated and live-confirmed | Web opens named-entity context | Preserve only when enabled and complete |
| Category link | `a.categoryLink[data-category-path][data-range]` | API-generated in source | No Core interaction owner | Unwrap to text |
| Image | `img[src,alt]` | Persisted but not confirmed in selected live Core probes | Web can render raw images | Replace with escaped alt text; defer loading |
| Block HTML | `p`, `div`, lists, headings, tables, blockquotes | Outside the persisted Version contract | Can survive legacy or direct writes | Unwrap with deterministic separation |
| Active content | Scripts, styles, templates, embedded documents, SVG, MathML, event handlers, active URLs | Hostile or out-of-contract | Not a supported text feature | Remove under a non-configurable rule |

### Footnote markup

The normalizer recognizes a `sup` whose class tokens contain `footnote-marker`, followed by an `i` whose class tokens contain `footnote`. It scans nested `i` elements and tolerates a malformed closing `</i >`. See [`sefaria/helper/normalization.py:153-198`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/helper/normalization.py#L153-L198).

Pinned tests establish nested ordinary italics inside a footnote and standalone removal of `sup.footnote-marker`, `sup.endFootnote`, and `sup.itag`. See [`sefaria/helper/tests/normalization_tests.py:8-43`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/helper/tests/normalization_tests.py#L8-L43).

Sefaria Web receives footnote bodies and markers. It handles marker clicks in the reader and styles `sup.footnote-marker`, `sup.endFootnote`, and `sup.itag`. See [`static/js/TextRange.jsx:225-229`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/TextRange.jsx#L225-L229) and [`static/css/s2.css:7667-7700`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/css/s2.css#L7667-L7700).

The August 30, 2026 deployed `Genesis 1:1` fixture contains:

```html
When God began to create<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup
><i class="footnote"><b>When God began to create </b>Others ...</i>
```

The source URL is `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Genesis%201%3A1?version=english%7CThe%20Contemporary%20Torah%2C%20Jewish%20Publication%20Society%2C%202006&return_format=default`.

### Commentary placement iTags

Sefaria Web converts only placements whose `data-commentator` matches the selected commentary. `data-label` becomes the marker when present; otherwise `data-order` is used and can be converted to a Hebrew numeral. See [`static/js/TextRange.jsx:528-552`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/TextRange.jsx#L528-L552).

The Shulchan Arukh migration script treats `data-commentator` and `data-order` as placement identity and order. See [`scripts/Even_HaEzer_add_itags_to_existing_links.py:35-60`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/scripts/Even_HaEzer_add_itags_to_existing_links.py#L35-L60).

The August 30, 2026 deployed Shulchan Arukh fixture contains empty commentary placements with `data-commentator`, `data-order`, and `data-label`. Labels include Hebrew letters and a diamond. One deployed attribute has malformed quoting around `Mishnah Berurah`; the project characterizes standards-parser recovery and does not guess the intended value.

The source URL is `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Shulchan%20Arukh%2C%20Orach%20Chayim%201?version=hebrew%7CMaginei%20Eretz%3A%20Shulchan%20Aruch%20Orach%20Chaim%2C%20Lemberg%2C%201893&return_format=default`.

### Structural overlays

Sefaria's persisted contract assigns `data-overlay` and `data-value` to empty `i` elements. Web CSS renders `Vilna Pages` and `Venice Columns`. See [`static/css/s2.css:7704-7722`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/css/s2.css#L7704-L7722).

August 30, 2026 deployed probes also found `Venice Pages`. The local contract therefore treats overlay names as inert data rather than enumerating only names with current Web CSS.

The representative source URL is `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Jerusalem%20Talmud%20Berakhot%201%3A1?version=hebrew%7CThe%20Jerusalem%20Talmud%2C%20edition%20by%20Heinrich%20W.%20Guggenheimer.%20Berlin%2C%20De%20Gruyter%2C%201999-2015&return_format=default`.

### Masorah markup and line structure

August 30, 2026 deployed Miqra according to the Masorah probes found `mam-spi-pe`, `mam-spi-samekh`, nested `mam-kq`, `mam-kq-k`, and `mam-kq-q` spans, `mam-kq-trivial`, and `br` line structure. The September 20, 2026 local Mongo inventory additionally found 9 `mam-spi-invnun` starts; this is corpus evidence rather than a deployed-behavior claim.

The Obadiah fixture contains:

```html
<span class="mam-kq-trivial">שְׁעָרָ֗ו</span>
```

The source URL is `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Obadiah%201?version=hebrew%7CMiqra%20according%20to%20the%20Masorah&return_format=default`.

The Song of Songs source URL is `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Song%20of%20Songs%201?version=hebrew%7CMiqra%20according%20to%20the%20Masorah&return_format=default`.

Poetry versions expose text line structure through `br` and version metadata. The `poetry` and `indentWhenWrap` classes are Web-generated presentation and are not source text classes.

### API-generated links

The v3 `wrap_all_entities` path can generate references with `class="refLink"`, `data-ref`, and `data-range`; named entities with `class="namedEntityLink"`, `data-slug`, and `data-range`; and categories with `class="categoryLink"`, `data-category-path`, and `data-range`.

See [`sefaria/model/marked_up_text_chunk.py:310-348`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/marked_up_text_chunk.py#L310-L348), [`sefaria/model/text_request_adapter.py:193-225`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text_request_adapter.py#L193-L225), and [`api/tests.py:201-220`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/api/tests.py#L201-L220).

The August 30, 2026 `Genesis 10` deployed probe confirmed reference and named-entity links. The source URL is `https://www.sefaria.org/api/v3/texts/Genesis%2010?version=english%7CThe%20Contemporary%20Torah%2C%20Jewish%20Publication%20Society%2C%202006&return_format=wrap_all_entities`.

Category anchors are source-confirmed but are not retained by the Core sanitizer because no Core component owns their interaction.

### Render and sanitation boundaries

Sefaria Web inserts processed text HTML with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. See [`static/js/ContentText.jsx:23-44`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/ContentText.jsx#L23-L44) and [`static/js/ContentText.jsx:93-99`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/ContentText.jsx#L93-L99).

The Linker uses DOMPurify for text extracted from the host page, but its popup writes Sefaria API text through `innerHTML` without that sanitation path. See [`static/js/linker.v3/main.js:12-19`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/linker.v3/main.js#L12-L19) and [`static/js/linker.v3/popup.js:308-319`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/linker.v3/popup.js#L308-L319).

Sefaria's broader `cleanHTML` helper permits many sheet-oriented tags, styles, and `href` without a hostname allowlist. See [`static/js/sefaria/util.js:266-293`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/sefaria/util.js#L266-L293). That helper is evidence of current Sefaria behavior, not the reusable component contract. The project intentionally applies a narrower allowlist and exact production-origin checks for third-party embedding.

Sefaria operates both `www.sefaria.org` and the Hebrew production origin `www.sefaria.org.il`. The project accepts relative Sefaria links but serializes them as canonical absolute `https://www.sefaria.org/...` URLs so embedding-page origins cannot change their destinations. It also permits HTTPS links on the apex or `www` host for the two production domains. It does not allow arbitrary Sefaria subdomains or generic HTTPS origins.

### Return-format information loss

The server's `strip_itags` operation removes footnote marker/body pairs, empty `i` elements carrying `data-commentator` or `data-overlay`, and `sup.footnote-marker`, `sup.endFootnote`, and `sup.itag`.

See [`sefaria/model/text.py:1278-1282`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text.py#L1278-L1282) and [`sefaria/helper/normalization.py:346-361`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/helper/normalization.py#L346-L361).

The v3 return format named `strip_only_footnotes` invokes this broader operation. The name therefore understates the removed annotation families.

Sefaria Mobile normally requests `stripItags: true` for main text. See [`Sefaria-Mobile/api.js:263-270`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/925420dcf7dd00a16f8dc4c4191284792fc3f9fa/api.js#L263-L270).

Live probes showed that `return_format=text_only` removes footnote content, not only tags. It also changes `G<small>OD</small>` to `GOD` in the JPS translation, losing the small-cap distinction for the Tetragrammaton. An empty extracted-note list therefore cannot prove that the source had no notes.

### Vocalization differences

The implementations disagree on U+05C0 PASEQ. The executable comparison and exact outputs are recorded under [Executable PASEQ references](#executable-paseq-references). The project exposes both source-derived policies, and `after-space` is the current default.

Sefaria Web's full vocalization-removal expression and the server's `strip_cantillation(..., strip_vowels=True)` range include U+05C3 SOF PASUQ, while the cantillation-only ranges do not. The local `none` mode therefore removes U+05C3 and `nikkud` preserves it.

### Source-only and intentionally unsupported forms

`u`, `sub`, and `img` are part of the persisted contract but were not found in the selected live Core fixtures. Their status is source-confirmed rather than live-confirmed. These labels describe the selected fixtures' provenance, not an absence of upstream documentation or upstream usage; all three tags are covered by the [upstream formatting documentation reviewed above](#upstream-documentation-coverage).

Images are intentionally disabled for Core. The sanitizer preserves escaped `alt` text and discards the image because no current component owns image loading or an image-origin policy.

Block elements are not part of the persisted Version contract. They are treated as legacy or out-of-contract input even though Sefaria's sheet cleaner accepts many block forms.

Generic and category links are intentionally unwrapped. The decision prevents unowned outbound navigation from HTML embedded in a third-party page.

### Text response shape

Targeted live `/api/v3/texts` probes on August 27, 2026 showed that text content lives under each item in `versions`.

`Genesis 1:1` returned a string. `Genesis 1:1-3` returned an array. `Genesis 1:31-2:2` returned nested arrays for the spanning range.

### Recursive text shape and side alignment

Targeted deployed `/api/v3/texts` probes on September 4, 2026 showed that recursive text shape is not determined by `isSpanning`.

`Likutei Moharan 1` returned nested arrays while `isSpanning` was `false`. `Genesis 1:31-2:2` returned nested arrays while `isSpanning` was `true`. A consumer must therefore follow the recursive `text` value itself rather than choosing a flattening rule from `isSpanning`.

The `Genesis 1:31-2:2` response returned `spanningRefs: ["Genesis 1:31", "Genesis 2:1-2"]` for two top-level groups while the text contained three leaf segments. `spanningRefs` labels groups rather than every leaf.

`Zohar, Bereshit 1-5` returned a Hebrew first group containing two strings while the corresponding English first group was an empty array. The two sides can therefore disagree in which position paths exist. Intersection alignment would discard returned source text.

`Tosafot on Shabbat 2a` returned one version shaped as `[[s,s,s],[],[],[s],[],[],[s]]` plus one missing-selector warning. Empty inner arrays occur as holes, and an entire requested side can be absent.

These observations do not establish a general reference-construction algorithm. The payload exposes address types that vary by work, and its group-level references do not identify every leaf. The source-card specification consequently uses positional item identity and does not synthesize leaf references.

### Bilingual version roles

Sefaria Web commit [`52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/tree/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8) treats reader sides as source or primary text and translation text, not fixed Hebrew and English families.

[`Hooks.jsx:13`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/Hooks.jsx#L13) states that the reader's `hebrew` interface value means the source text. It uses `primaryLang` or `translationLang` as the shown content language.

[`sefaria.js:790-829`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/sefaria/sefaria.js#L790-L829) resolves primary and translation versions through `isPrimary`, `isSource`, saved preferences, and the translation-language preference. If no concrete version is found, it uses the reserved `primary` or `translation` selector.

[`sefaria.js:632-647`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/sefaria/sefaria.js#L632-L647) sorts serialized version parameters before the request. Query order cannot identify the primary and translation sides.

The pinned [`text_request_adapter.py:70-90`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/sefaria/model/text_request_adapter.py#L70-L90) evaluates each selector against its own role predicate and optional exact version title. It can return a version with `isPrimary: true` for a `translation|versionTitle` selector when that version is not a source, and it de-duplicates a version selected by both parameters.

On September 3, 2026, the deployed request `Kuzari 1:1?version=primary&version=translation|Yehudah Even Shmuel, 1973` returned `Sefer haKuzari - Project Ben-Yehuda` and `Yehudah Even Shmuel, 1973`. Both versions had `isPrimary: true` and `isSource: false`, with no warnings. `isPrimary` therefore cannot identify one unique side across the complete response. An exact selector must claim its matching version before the opposite bare selector falls back to role flags.

[`text_request_adapter.py:88-92`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/sefaria/model/text_request_adapter.py#L88-L92) records a missing `(language, versionTitle)` selector only when no version matches it.

[`api/views.py:47-60`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/api/views.py#L47-L60) converts each missing selector into one warning keyed by its language, or by `language|versionTitle` when the selector carried a version title. The warning describes request selection, not an existing returned version.

The warning key is not the original query value. [`api/views.py:39-45`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/api/views.py#L39-L45) splits a piped `version` parameter and replaces `_` with a space in the version title before the key is built:

```python
params[1] = params[1].replace('_', ' ')
```

A request for `primary|The_Title` therefore returns the warning key `primary|The Title`. A consumer that matches a warning to its originating selector must apply the same substitution. Exact string equality against the sent value silently fails to match whenever a requested version title contains an underscore.

Sefaria's own reader does not depend on this. It requests the bare `primary` and `translation` selectors, whose keys carry no version title and need no substitution.

### Bilingual layout and alignment

The reader keeps visible languages and bilingual layout as two independent settings. [`ReaderApp.jsx:974-993`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/ReaderApp.jsx#L974-L993) defaults `language` to `bilingual` and `biLayout` to `stacked`, and [`LayoutButtons.jsx:36`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/LayoutButtons.jsx#L36) writes whichever of the two the current mode owns.

[`ReaderPanel.jsx:637-641`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/ReaderPanel.jsx#L637-L641) forces a stacked layout below 500 pixels.

Side-by-side alignment is CSS only. [`s2.css:7056-7110`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/css/s2.css#L7056-L7110) sets each side to half width and floats it, and each segment emits its own clearing element. No script measures or synchronizes the two sides, so unequal lengths need no measurement.

The reader's `heLeft` and `heRight` layout values are labelled in direction terms but implemented as primary-side placement. [`LayoutButtons.jsx:19-31`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/LayoutButtons.jsx#L19-L31) treats `heLeft` as primary on the left, while [`constants.js:8-11`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/52e00f8bef430cba25a091f4443345ee1890e6c8/static/js/constants.js#L8-L11) labels it as right-to-left text left of left-to-right text. The two agree only when the primary side is right-to-left. This project names the equivalent property by role for that reason.

This evidence supports a text-segment projection that accepts one already-resolved `CoreV3Version`. The bilingual composite owns role resolution, and text segment remains the single owner of segment transformation.

## Upstream OpenAPI drift observation

**Observed September 28, 2026 with `pnpm openapi:drift`:** the latest commit on `Sefaria/Sefaria-Project` `master` that changed `docs/openAPI.json` is [`898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/docs/openAPI.json), committed September 14, 2026. Its SHA-256 is `3a6057ad40ca8e7874d6be97ed2491926818e3a6939c61cca67c9878da9aa4ab`; the pinned [`1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/docs/openAPI.json) input is `2bd2618411afc668eef1d100da546b04431ce82b984da0ae96823f24a8f890e4`. The only differences are the `get` operation of `/api/calendars/topics/parasha` and the `SearchPOSTData` schema. Every `x-sefaria-guards` precondition still holds against the upstream file. This drift has not been source-reviewed, and the pin is unchanged.

**Observed September 28, 2026 with GitHub REST API `2026-03-10`:** a live `pnpm openapi:drift --issue` run updated the existing [drift issue #37](https://github.com/Arithmomaniac/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/issues/37), returned `status=drift`, `handoff=false`, and `issue-number=37`, and created no comment or duplicate issue. The `2026-03-10` header also succeeded for the upstream GitHub API read. [GitHub's version guide](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/about-the-rest-api/api-versions) gives March 10, 2028 as the end of support for `2022-11-28`; the [breaking-change guide](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/about-the-rest-api/breaking-changes?apiVersion=2026-03-10) lists removed legacy response fields for some issue endpoints, none consumed by this detector. The Copilot assignment write was not performed in this smoke test.

### September 29, 2026 source review of drift at `898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be`

`pnpm openapi:drift` again resolved the complete commit [`898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/docs/openAPI.json) and digest `3a6057ad40ca8e7874d6be97ed2491926818e3a6939c61cca67c9878da9aa4ab`. The prior pin was `1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6`. Exactly two declarations changed, and **no overlay precondition failed**. The existing overlay has no action for either declaration or its referenced objects; its corrections and guards are unchanged. The source review below is agent-prepared, **not yet human-reviewed**.

| Changed declaration / affected consumer | Classification and source | Dated bounded observation | Shared-component and overlay decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/calendars/topics/parasha`: optional `diaspora` query string enum `"0" \| "1"`, default `"1"`; the existing `CalendarParashaTopicJSON` response references `ref` and is unchanged. Only this operation consumes `CalendarParashaTopicJSON`. | **Refresh only.** [Route](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/urls_shared.py#L107-L110), [handler](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/reader/views.py#L2963-L2974), [calendar selection](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/utils/calendars.py#L316-L327), and [response builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/utils/calendars.py#L285-L308): the handler rejects other values as a JSON error, maps `"0"` to false, and selects calendar records whose `diaspora` is false or null; omitted and `"1"` select true or null. No dedicated test for this endpoint or selector was found in the inspected [calendar tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/utils/tests/calendars_test.py) or [API endpoint tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/api-tests/test_endpoints.py). | September 29, 2026 UTC, four GETs to `https://www.sefaria.org`: `/api/calendars/topics/parasha` (200), `?diaspora=1` (200), `?diaspora=0` (200), `?diaspora=x` (200 JSON `{"error":"'Diaspora' parameter must be 1 or 0."}`). The three successes each had `title`, `displayValue`, `url`, `ref`, `heRef`, `order`, `category`, `extraDetails`, `description`, `topic` and the same `ref` (`Deuteronomy 14:22-16:17`). This date does not exercise a differing-reading week; the pinned selection branch, not today's equal readings, establishes the `"0"` behavior. Deployment of the pinned commit is not inferred. | No newly shared transport shape: the response schema and nested `ref` are unchanged and only this operation owns this schema. No overlay mutation or guard needed. Generated request type and SDK query-serialization regression added. |
| `SearchPOSTData.sort_fields`: remove the old `["pagesheetrank"]` schema default and clarify score weighting; only `POST /api/search-wrapper` consumes this request component, and its `searchResponse` remains unchanged. | **Refresh only.** [Route](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/urls_shared.py#L196-L198), [handler and response builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/reader/views.py#L4926-L4951), [default normalizer and query builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/helper/search.py#L42-L68) [including conditional score weighting](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/helper/search.py#L72-L143): absent `sort_fields` becomes `[]`; `score` adds `function_score` **only for exactly one field**. [Helper tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/helper/tests/search_test.py#L53-L76) cover one-field pagesheetrank and explicit empty-field score branches. [Endpoint tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/api-tests/test_search.py#L14-L21) make GET requests only, not POST payload assertions. The upstream phrase “Required when `sort_method = 'score'`” means required **to obtain weighting**, not required for a valid request: the schema leaves the field optional and the builder accepts its absence. | September 29, 2026 UTC, three read-only JSON POSTs to `https://www.sefaria.org/api/search-wrapper`, all with `query:"Micah", type:"text", size:1`: `sort_method:"score"` with no `sort_fields` returned 200, `hits.total=547`, one hit, `_score=16.644789`; score with `sort_fields:["pagesheetrank"]` returned 200, same total/count and `_score=1363265.9`; `sort_method:"sort"` without fields returned 200, same total/count and `_score=16.644789`. One-hit scores are observations, not proof of ranking order or deployment identity. | No shared component proposal: the request and response components each have one operation consumer, and their nested result fields did not change. No overlay mutation/guard needed; a red-then-green regression asserts omitted fields stay absent after Zod parsing and an explicit field survives. |

**Probe budget:** seven public, read-only requests total (four GET and three search POST), with search `size:1`; only status, bounded top-level keys, counts, and first score were inspected, not full hit bodies. The search POST is a non-mutating query. Source evidence and tests above, not a single deployed response, establish both changes.

**Pre-existing mismatch reviewed September 29, 2026, for an additional calendar correction:** At the pinned [`898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/docs/openAPI.json), the [calendar route](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/urls_shared.py#L107-L110) calls the [handler](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/reader/views.py#L2963-L2974), which returns `{"error": "'Diaspora' parameter must be 1 or 0."}` for an invalid parameter and otherwise uses the [calendar response builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/utils/calendars.py#L285-L308), which always supplies `ref` on success. The [JSON response helper](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/client/util.py#L14-L34) defaults to HTTP 200, and the [error decorator](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/system/decorators.py#L33-L45) also uses it for `InputError`. The upstream [calendar tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/utils/tests/calendars_test.py) and [endpoint tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/api-tests/test_endpoints.py) have no dedicated test for this error branch. A fresh bounded GET to `https://www.sefaria.org/api/calendars/topics/parasha?diaspora=x` on September 29, 2026 returned HTTP 200, `application/json; charset=utf-8`, and exactly `{"error": "'Diaspora' parameter must be 1 or 0."}`; the fixed fixture `packages/client/test/fixtures/calendar-parasha-error-2026-09-29.json` preserves it. This is dated deployed corroboration, not proof of deployment of the pinned SHA. Both existing success schemas have only optional fields, so before correction the generated validator accepts `{"error": "..."}` as a success-shaped object; a discriminating union needs `ref` required on the calendar success branch. The corrected HTTP 200 error remains a data variant, not a typed HTTP error status.

**Search error still unresolved, outside the qualified correction:** The [search route](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/urls_shared.py#L195-L198) maps to the [POST handler and response builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/reader/views.py#L4926-L4951). When `response.success()` is false it calls the [same JSON helper](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/client/util.py#L14-L34) with an error string containing shard counts and timeout state, which would give HTTP 200; successful response JSON comes from `response.to_dict().body`. The upstream [search endpoint tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/api-tests/test_search.py#L14-L21) cover GET, not a POST backend failure; the [search helper tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be/sefaria/helper/tests/search_test.py#L53-L76) test query construction, not this response branch. No deployed or reviewed fixture shows this failure branch, and forcing a live backend failure is inappropriate. A connection exception is a separate possible failure, not qualified by the `response.success() == false` branch. Do not add a search response union until a safe fixture or upstream test qualifies its exact response. Other search-field defaults remain unaudited. No changed contract remains unqualified for the pin refresh.

## Full pinned OpenAPI expansion

**Observed September 20, 2026 from the pinned OpenAPI and local export:** the corrected document contains 60 operations across the `Text`, `Index`, `Related`, `Calendars`, `Lexicon`, `Topic`, `Term`, `Sheets`, `Collections`, `Misc`, and `Ref` tags. Generation retains the complete document and exposes those operations through the corresponding 11 root namespaces. No live Sefaria requests were made during this expansion.

The local export at `C:\_SRC\Sefaria-Export.data\mongo\extracted\dump\sefaria` was inspected with MongoDB Database Tools `bsondump` 100.18.0. The existing bounded sample from `texts.bson` contains recursively nested `chapter` arrays. Direct reads from `manuscripts.bson` confirmed stored manuscript records with `slug`, English and Hebrew titles, source, and descriptions. Direct reads from `term.bson` confirmed term records with Extended JSON numeric values and multilingual title arrays. These records establish stored-data variants and collection availability; they are not treated as HTTP response payloads.

The maintained response-contract test validates every JSON response example for the 52 newly included operations against the generated status-specific Zod schema. Existing source-backed fixtures continue to qualify the eight previously generated operations. The sheet examples exposed numeric and string sheet identifiers, legacy empty-array options, boolean or numeric option flags, and timezone-free ISO-formatted timestamps. The guarded overlay now models those variants. The manuscripts response uses the corrected `application/json` media type, and the image-generation operation remains the document's declared `image/png` response.

The approved reusable transport components are limited to version metadata and sheet topic/tag fields. `CoreVersionMetadata` is shared by `VersionJSON` and `versionData` after preserving the reviewed nullable source and status fields. `CoreSheetTopic` owns `slug`, `asTyped`, `en`, and `he`; `UserSheetTagJSON` adds only `count`. No generalized domain model or shared reference-topic-link component was added.

### Current front-end cache

The current front-end text cache grows for the lifetime of the page. It has no eviction and no expiry.

The front end also combines concurrent requests for the same URL.

## Bilingual layout

The measured Sefaria web layout uses neither flex nor grid.

The measured mechanism preserves alignment between unequal Hebrew and English text.

## Linker style isolation

The Linker emits `<style scoped>` at `popup.js:56`.

Current browsers ignore the removed `scoped` attribute. Popup rules and font imports therefore apply to the host page.

Generic selectors can change host elements. Each host also receives imports for Crimson Text, Frank Ruhl Libre, and Heebo.

A shadow root supplies the isolation that the existing markup assumes.

## Linker detection and browser-test observations

The Linker source observations in this section use Sefaria commit [`1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/tree/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6).

The pinned [`find_refs_api`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/views.py#L519-L538) always enqueues a task and returns HTTP 202 with a task identifier. The pinned [`async_task_status_api`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/views.py#L540-L586) returns HTTP 202 while pending, HTTP 200 on success, and HTTP 500 on task failure.

The pinned response builder [`_make_find_refs_response_inner`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/helper/linker/linker.py#L236-L263) records failed matches with `refs: null` and keys `refData` by canonical reference. The pinned OpenAPI input instead models `refs` only as an array and models a literal `RefTitle` property. These are transport-contract mismatches that require guarded correction before the Linker integration can consume generated validators.

The pinned browser script [`static/js/linker.v3/main.js`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/linker.v3/main.js) uses Readability over a document clone, removes tables and superscripts from extraction, supports an additional whitelist selector, excludes existing anchors from wrapping, submits one find-refs task, and polls the task. Its configured polling has 15 retries after the first attempt, waits from 500 milliseconds up to 5 seconds with factor 1.5, and sets a 120-second retry-time limit. Popup mode requests up to 20 text segments per reference per language.

The script does not install a mutation observer. Its `dynamic` option changes canonical-URL selection; a host calls the public `link()` function again to process changed content.

The pinned [`static/test/linker_test.html`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/test/linker_test.html) is a manually exercised page with English and Hebrew citations, ranges, punctuation, inline markup, exclusions, existing links, and negative text. It loads Linker v2 rather than v3.

The pinned Python tests cover helper response construction, preferred versions, truncation, server-side resolution, and paragraph splitting. Several helper tests refer to an older private helper name while the inspected implementation exports `unpack_find_refs_request`; no dedicated v3 browser or asynchronous route test was located in the inspected JavaScript, E2E, or Python test paths. This project therefore treats those files as scenario and source evidence, not as proof that an upstream v3 browser suite currently passes.

## Linker theme behavior

The popup stylesheet contains fixed foreground and background colors. It has no `prefers-color-scheme` behavior.

A dark host page receives a light popup by default.

Host CSS can override the popup only because the styles leak. This is not a stable theme contract.

## Linker keyboard behavior

The deployed popup:

- sets `role="dialog"`
- moves focus into the popup
- restores focus to the trigger
- closes on Escape
- connects the trigger with `aria-controls`

Its Tab handler calls `preventDefault()` without a new focus target. The handler suppresses Tab instead of cycling focus.

The close control is a `div`. It has no accessible name or keyboard handler.

## Web footnote keyboard behavior

The web reader's `sup.footnote-marker` has a delegated click handler at `TextRange.jsx:229`.

Its style has `:hover` at `s2.css:6551-6559`, but no `:focus`. The marker has no `tabindex`.

## Consumer implementations

Torah Chat teaches reference normalization and URL construction through prompt examples in `src/prompts.ts`.

Its concise-mode handler tells the model not to summarize returned source text in `src/chat-engine.ts`.

These patterns show consumer demand for reference handling and a rendered source surface.

`bisl-torah` has a two-state vowel control and three layout modes. Those choices support separate vocalization controls and an `auto` bilingual layout.

## Sefaria web response caching

**Observed on September 6, 2026:** the Sefaria web frontend at commit [`05863b62ce0b7aa176b74df3bc8bfbdeb0bf171f`](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/05863b62ce0b7aa176b74df3bc8bfbdeb0bf171f/static/js/sefaria/sefaria.js) uses process-local JavaScript objects for completed API data and a separate `_ajaxObjects` store for in-flight request reuse.

`getTextsFromAPIV3` uses the complete generated URL as both the request URL and `_textsStore` cache key. `getVersions` uses a reference-keyed `_versions` store. `_cachedApiPromise` returns a stored value or delegates to `_ApiPromise`, then stores the completed payload. `_ApiPromise` shares an in-flight request by URL and removes it after settlement.

The inspected helper has no TTL, entry-count limit, retained-byte limit, persistence, or stale-return branch. Older text-cache paths also seed or reconstruct related reference entries. This repository adopts only bounded reuse of completed validated responses. It intentionally does not copy Sefaria's global stores, in-flight coalescing, reference-derived cache population, or text-range reconstruction.

## MCP server observations

At [`d4096024ae2aac9fae160ad5a9c652e4e77fc6e0`](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-mcp/tree/d4096024ae2aac9fae160ad5a9c652e4e77fc6e0), `Sefaria/sefaria-mcp` is a Python and FastMCP service.

The server has approximately 14 tools. It also has SSE routes, OAuth metadata stubs, Prometheus metrics, Docker packaging, and an unpinned FastMCP dependency.

The pinned [`get_text` registration](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-mcp/blob/d4096024ae2aac9fae160ad5a9c652e4e77fc6e0/src/sefaria_mcp/tools.py) accepts `reference` and optional `version_language`. The pinned [`get_text` implementation](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-mcp/blob/d4096024ae2aac9fae160ad5a9c652e4e77fc6e0/src/sefaria_mcp/logic.py) maps `source`, `english`, and `both` to `GET /api/v3/texts/{reference}` version parameters, optimizes the response, and returns JSON as text. It does not return MCP `structuredContent`.

The same pinned tool registration exposes `get_links_between_texts(reference, with_text="0")`. Its implementation calls `/api/links/{reference}` with `with_text` and returns optimized JSON as text. The current local Node integration preserves that name and explicit input vocabulary while using initialized-client MCP Apps loader only when the caller omits the option.

The corrected v3 contract distinguishes `version=source` from `version=primary`: `source` selects the original language, while `primary` selects a version whose database record has `isPrimary: true`; the contract names Kuzari as a case where those can differ. Because the source-card factory resolves its primary side through `isPrimary` and its translation side through `!isSource`, the demonstration preserves the official MCP tool's public `source` and `english` choices but maps them to `version=primary` and `version=translation`. Requesting `version=source` could otherwise return a valid version that the rendering authority correctly declines to project as the primary side.

A server copy creates a large maintenance surface.

The superseded FastMCP 3.2.4 prototype supported MCP Apps through:

- `@mcp.resource("ui://...")`
- `text/html;profile=mcp-app` resources
- `AppConfig(resourceUri="ui://...")` on tools

That prototype established that a small additive integration was feasible, but it did not provide the retained compiled Node stdio, Streamable HTTP, or browser-host topology.

The MCP tools specification reviewed on September 6, 2026 requires `structuredContent` to be a JSON object. The corrected `GET /api/links/{tref}` success response is an array, so the MCP connections result wraps that unchanged response in the specified minimal `{ payload: ... }` envelope. This is an integration constraint and does not change the corrected generated endpoint contract.

The installed `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` 1.7.5 declarations expose `getHostCapabilities().message.text` and `sendMessage` for user-role content. The installed MCP TypeScript SDK 1.30.0 exposes initialized client capabilities on each server instance. Apps rendering loader and host text-message loader are separate negotiations, but current host implementations accept `ui/message` without advertising the optional message loader.

The Apps package's peer range is `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.29.0`, so SDK 1.30.0 is compatible. The reference host and sandbox implementation were checked against Apps source commit [`92f46a574568a3ddac7600343b7d3c4c4ed7b588`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/tree/92f46a574568a3ddac7600343b7d3c4c4ed7b588). MCP Inspector 1.0.2 remains on the compatible SDK 1 line (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.25.2`) and supports the repository's Node 22.12 minimum. Inspector 2 uses SDK 2 packages and requires Node 22.19, so it was not used to rewrite the locked SDK 1 integration incidentally.

The deterministic Node acceptance starts compiled stdio and stateful Streamable HTTP servers, serves the App and sandbox from separate origins with header-delivered CSP, and drives the packaged App through the official `AppBridge`. With cache disabled and an unexpected-request-rejecting transport, it proves the text local loader, one links continuation, bounded connection qualification, links local-loader admission, local navigation, invalid corrected JSON paths, denied calls, cancellation, and stale-result suppression. The official Inspector separately lists the two compiled stdio tools and their App resource metadata.

Current host source inspected on September 6, 2026 shows two successful delivery semantics. VS Code main commit [`3d7cfab6d77dce362755ac573a7a350e8f64528f`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/3d7cfab6d77dce362755ac573a7a350e8f64528f/src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/widget/chatContentParts/toolInvocationParts/chatMcpAppModel.ts) handles `ui/message`, omits the text-message loader from initialization, and places supplied text in the chat composer for explicit submission. GitHub Copilot desktop main commit [`106725d88302dc1f6f1d187622204cf4fa9283d8`](https://github.com/github/github-app/blob/106725d88302dc1f6f1d187622204cf4fa9283d8/src/hooks/useMcpAppBridge.ts) also omits the loader, while its consent-gated handler enqueues the supplied prompt automatically. The App therefore attempts the method after explicit user activation and interprets a successful response as host delivery rather than gating the attempt on incomplete loader advertisements.

On September 6, 2026, a live request through the current demonstration server returned HTTP 200 for `Leviticus 19:18`, normalized the response reference to `Leviticus 19:18`, and returned two versions for `version_language=both`. A live request for `Genesis 999:1` returned the documented HTTP 404 object `{ "error": "Genesis ends at Chapter 50." }`. These probes confirm the current server wiring; the pinned corrected OpenAPI document and source audit remain the transport authority.

## MCP host interaction

A June experiment used LibreChat, a Copilot bridge, and VS Code.

Buttons in the MCP interface window did not work at the end of that experiment. The evidence does not show a component failure.

Host support changes quickly. The Core MCP flow therefore uses a narrow interaction set and names one tested host.

On September 6, 2026, the Playwright host harness successfully launched VS Code Insiders `1.127.0-insider` commit `2858f2c0200dc2f4f87aca248c69daaf85f3ce69`, opened its bundled GitHub Copilot Chat `0.55.2026062304`, loaded this worktree, opened Chat, and submitted the `get_text` prompt through the real editor surface. Its disposable profile was not authenticated, so that run stopped before model execution and did not produce an acceptance screenshot.

Later on September 6, 2026, an authenticated standard-profile VS Code session invoked `get_text` from `sefaria-components-demo` and rendered the packaged bilingual source card inline. The user-supplied screenshot showed the Hebrew and English text, source and translation attribution, source links, and the follow-up model response. This established host rendering acceptance, but it was not an automated isolated-profile capture.

Stable VS Code `1.136.1`, commit `a44adf7f53e00964ab890f9f8758a334f1fc15bc`, includes bundled Copilot Chat `0.64.1`. The checked-in `.vscode/mcp.json` uses VS Code's `servers` configuration with a portable `${workspaceFolder}` path. The current bootstrap creates a persistent `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SefariaMcpDemo` environment with separate user-data, extensions, Copilot home, and shared-data directories, empty VS Code and Agent Host MCP configurations, and automatic MCP discovery disabled. The Playwright harness reuses that environment and requires one interactive Copilot sign-in before its first automated capture.

The first authenticated isolated-profile attempt showed that `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir` alone do not isolate Agent Host or VS Code shared application storage. The failure screenshot showed unrelated `ado` and `working` server startup, the Agent Host log read `C:\Users\avilevin\.copilot\settings.json`, and the main-process log opened `C:\Users\avilevin\.vscode-shared\sharedStorage\state.vscdb`.

The next attempt isolated `COPILOT_HOME` and shared data, but the dedicated profile's `mcpToolCache` still referenced plugins below `C:\Users\avilevin\.copilot\installed-plugins`. This established that VS Code customization discovery also used the process home and that stale MCP tool state survived in profile storage. The corrected launcher additionally isolates `HOME` and `USERPROFILE` and clears only workspace chat state, Agent Host session state, and the `mcpInputs` and `mcpToolCache` records before launch. Authentication files and unrelated global state remain intact. These are host-configuration failures and corrections, not component failures.

After those corrections, the host showed only `sefaria-components-demo`, discovered `get_text`, and generated the expected `Leviticus 19:18` tool input. Copilot's persisted permission format represents a server-scoped approval as `{ "kind": "mcp", "serverName": "sefaria-components-demo" }` under the exact workspace location. The bootstrap writes only that approval and does not enable bypass approvals or general MCP auto-approval. VS Code `1.136.1` nevertheless displayed **Allow in this Session**, so the harness accepts that explicit host control during the run.

The first minimized launcher rebuilt a PowerShell command line from JSON. Windows PowerShell 5.1 deserialized the argument list as a nested object array, and `Start-Process` either rejected the array or reparsed the reconstructed string without exposing the requested CDP endpoint. The superseded correction used Python `subprocess.Popen` with an argument vector and `SW_SHOWMINIMIZED`, preserving every VS Code switch without taking foreground focus.

**Observed September 14, 2026 in the bounded Windows launcher parity experiment:** a Node caller passed a native-launch request to a narrow PowerShell `CreateProcessW` helper. The launched probe observed `STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW` with `SW_SHOWMINIMIZED`, received exact arguments containing spaces, an embedded quote, and a trailing backslash, received the isolated environment marker, and reported the same PID returned by the helper. The helper used `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT`; the retained regression also launches a descendant and verifies exact-process-tree cleanup. The launch-only request contained neither `--remote-debugging-port` nor `--enable-smoke-test-driver`. This qualifies the retained Windows launcher behavior; it does not claim that `SW_SHOWMINIMIZED` prevents every possible focus change by Windows or Electron.

**Accepted September 14, 2026 in the authenticated isolated VS Code walkthrough:** the Node-launched harness completed all eight retained stages in VS Code `1.137.0` with bundled Copilot Chat `0.65.0`. The machine-readable result records the initial Micah 6:8 Reader, local category and paging operations, host-proxied navigation through Agra DeKala, Balak 18 to Exodus 15:15, explicit `ui/message` export, and local middle/root breadcrumb restoration. Capture mode published only the initial Reader, retained hierarchy, and chat-export screenshots after the complete walkthrough succeeded; the six former intermediate captures were removed.

This approach follows the first-party Chat smoke harness in [`chat-memory-smoke.mts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/db6d403525ea73476aee6894d5f635171b583ff8/.github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scripts/chat-memory-smoke.mts#L2287-L2406): launch a real VS Code process with `--enable-smoke-test-driver`, an isolated `--user-data-dir`, `--extensions-dir`, and `--remote-debugging-port`; wait for the CDP endpoint; then attach Playwright. The repository adds the persistent authenticated shared-data, Copilot-home, process-home, minimized Windows launch, MCP cache cleanup, and source-card assertions required by this demonstration.

On September 6, 2026, the final harness launched stable VS Code `1.136.1` minimized with the authenticated isolated profile, connected over CDP, opened Copilot Chat, submitted the `get_text` prompt, accepted the session-scoped tool approval, and captured `docs/images/mcp-app-vscode.png`. The screenshot shows the Hebrew and English text, footnote interaction, primary-text and translation attribution, and only the `sefaria-components-demo` workflow. After capture, the harness closes the CDP-enabled process and relaunches the same isolated workspace minimized without a debugging port for continued manual exploration.

The extended September 6, 2026 walkthrough completed the source-card baseline, omitted-option Micah 6:8 connections request, category switching, paging, selected-source retrieval, explicit metadata-only request, and explicit preview reload. In the final flow, each App action sends `ui/message`, VS Code fills the real composer with the exact request, and the harness submits that composer before observing the expected later tool result. The machine-readable result records both delivery modes as `composer-submitted`; it does not claim that VS Code submits `ui/message` automatically.

A September 6, 2026 probe of the deployed `Genesis` v3 text response returned approximately 682 KB and more than 1,500 aligned segments. Passing that payload through the synchronous source-card projection would create thousands of rendered text-side values, so the demonstration server rejects successful payloads above 400 text leaves and directs callers to request a narrower reference.

The local Web checkout is pinned to `1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6`; the local Mobile checkout is pinned to `925420dcf7dd00a16f8dc4c4191284792fc3f9fa`. Both were clean when inspected. These observations describe those commits, not an assertion about current deployed clients.

Web [segment construction](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/sefaria/sefaria.js#L2477-L2542) derives addresses from section metadata, offsets, and adapted address values. [Context loading](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/sefaria/sefaria.js#L830-L846) obtains the target and its section separately. The [v3 builder](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/text_request_adapter.py#L94-L147) supplies normalized string addresses and trimmed offsets; the Web adapter's numeric assumptions cannot be copied directly. [Offset tests](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/tests/index_offsets_by_depth_tests.py) establish offset and Talmud counterexamples.

The pinned [address-type definitions](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/sefaria/model/schema.py#L2673-L2807) show that `Year`, `Aliyah`, `Perek`, `Pasuk`, `Mishnah`, `Volume`, `Siman`, `Halakhah`, `Seif`, `SeifKatan`, and `Section` inherit integer addressing. Deployed Genesis v3 payloads use `Perek` and `Pasuk`, so checking only the literal `Integer` transport value rejects valid ordinary text.

Mobile [API adaptation](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/925420dcf7dd00a16f8dc4c4191284792fc3f9fa/api.js#L53-L75) derives offset-aware segment numbers. Its [reader loading](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/925420dcf7dd00a16f8dc4c4191284792fc3f9fa/ReaderApp.js#L665-L710) opens ranges at their first ref and separates requested target from displayed section. The planned demo follows first-segment behavior but not Mobile's string-splitting shortcut.

Web [connection details](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/1f7d0844ca6a9eddc8e48168962aacb09de75bd6/static/js/TextList.jsx#L155-L184) render connected text ranges. Mobile [long-text handling](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Mobile/blob/925420dcf7dd00a16f8dc4c4191284792fc3f9fa/ReaderApp.js#L1392-L1404) truncates near 3,500 raw characters. The planned preview intentionally counts rendered graphemes and preserves balanced markup instead. Mobile uses a virtualized list with visibility-triggered content loading; the planned library uses explicit 20-entry pages and text-inclusive links responses to avoid child requests. No upstream parity is claimed for page size or fetch policy.

The planned source-card addressability contract supersedes the earlier blanket exclusion of leaf refs only for proven single-section numbered shapes. The planned all-category connections contract supersedes Commentary-only delivery language; it does not expand into sheets, other tools, or MCP acceptance.
