# Development

This contributor guide describes the maintained source tree and npm-only release lifecycle. The repository's specifications define intended behavior; implementation and tests establish what is currently delivered. Public consumers use the synchronized `@sefaria` npm packages and version-pinned npm CDN files from [Install and status](help/install-and-status.md). Provider observations and conditional documentation deployment gates belong in [Evidence](evidence.md#conditional-post-launch-documentation).

The sections below separate delivered baseline behavior, changes from older plans, and work that remains intended. A runnable command is not proof that the corresponding integration is finished.

## Replacement repository baseline

The toolkit is maintained on `main` in `Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit`; implementation pull requests target `main`. Its workflow requires the complete deterministic gate on both Ubuntu and Windows behind the stable `check` status for pull requests and pushes to `main`. Package publication and Pages deployment are separate guarded workflows. Failure-only CI artifacts are restricted to setup/check results and maintained browser diagnostics.

The conditional GitHub-hosted Copilot setup workflow exists on the default branch, but real cloud-agent activation and qualification remain separate delivery work. The workflow recognizes the toolkit from its package identity rather than a branch name.

Run the deterministic workflow-policy regression with:

```powershell
pnpm test -- tests/workflow-policy.test.ts
```

The `integration:check` stage also parses active paths, package manifests, workflow YAML, and the lockfile. It rejects active Python runtime/build files, retired demo assembly, source export fallbacks, non-private source manifests, unapproved publication/deployment workflows and credentials, remote tarball resolutions, and unsupported installation claims. The exact guarded CI, manual npm release, reusable validation, Pages, and maintenance workflows are admitted explicitly. Missing reusable workflow definitions also fail the gate. Historical evidence and immutable archive links are outside those active-path checks.

The same stage reconciles committed source-stamped inventories containing the 73 test files from `Arithmomaniac/sefaria-web-components@7bc2d258fac2959beb5252ebdbcbddbaccd0c7b7` and the nine pre-retirement showcase tests from `Arithmomaniac/sefaria-web-components@d7e2d59645ebf7427dcff2cbdd78073e2e7df58c`. It requires every retained destination to appear in Vitest's actual static discovery output and records a specific reason for each presentation-only or superseded retirement. The gate does not query or fetch the source repository's Git objects.

[`IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/blob/main/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) is a historical bootstrap artifact. Its follow-on waves are complete, and it is not a maintained execution handoff or a normative component or transport specification. Use this development guide for the current baseline and the [repository issues](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/issues) for remaining delivery work.

## Contributor guides

For reader-oriented explanations, use the friendly guides rather than the archived demo transcripts:

- [How the pieces fit together](concepts/how-the-toolkit-works.md)
- [Render text](data-and-text-tools/clean-up-stored-sefaria-text.md)
- [Text markup](concepts/clean-text-and-safety.md)

- [Reader navigation and host boundaries](use-components/add-the-complete-reader.md)

## Implemented on this baseline

| Area | Baseline status |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/client` | Delivers all 60 operations in the pinned OpenAPI through 11 tag namespaces, committed corrected TypeScript contracts, reusable transport schemas, Zod validators, JSON and PNG response handling, and a status-aware fetch client with a bounded default-on per-client response cache. The corrected OpenAPI document is temporary generation output. A weekly workflow reports upstream OpenAPI drift in one issue and can hand it to a Copilot triage agent that proposes a draft refresh. |
| `packages/text-transform` | Delivers DOM-free sanitization, Hebrew vocalization modes, structured footnote extraction, and bounded connected-text previews. |
| `packages/web-components` | Delivers five declarative elements with standalone `sref`, authoritative raw `data` for Text Segment, Bilingual Segment, and Source Card, local-data capabilities for mutable Reader and Connections Panel flows, tagged source, read-only status and diagnostics, lifecycle reconnect, error events, private preparation, shared raw Reader source qualification, and the supported advanced DOM-free Reader semantic/raw facade. |
| `examples/explorer` | Provides one developer surface for supplied-data authored states and click-to-start live pages for text segments, bilingual segments, source cards, and contextual connections. Opening a live route makes no Sefaria request before activation. |
| `examples/reader` | Demonstrates a regular website host with viewport-height spatial panes over the lower-level reader session and shared browser data source, plus an interactive host that assigns explicit source and `sref` to the supported `<sefaria-reader>` component. |
| `examples/vanilla-vite` | Exercises installed public client, Source Card raw-data, source, and custom-element registration paths with a validated supplied `Micah 6:8` response followed by an explicit live request. |
| `examples/react-vite` | Demonstrates React 19 declarative custom-element properties and events, supplied-data precedence, standalone `sref`, reversible vocalization, stable identity, and explicit live activation. |
| `examples/alpine-vite` | Demonstrates the same Source Card flow with Alpine 3.17.2, scalar attribute bindings, property-only raw data and source, events, and destroy cleanup. |
| `examples/linked-article` | Progressively enhances authored Sefaria anchors with Source Card in a page-owned native modal dialog after eligible activation while preserving native navigation, focus return, visible failures, and cleanup. |
| `examples/mcp-app` | Exposes shared `get_text` and adaptive `get_links_between_texts` registration through compiled Node stdio and Streamable HTTP transports and a static in-browser MCP host, packages a single-file App, validates corrected payloads and metadata, proves AppBridge request counts and sandbox isolation, and retains the optional authenticated isolated VS Code hierarchy walkthrough with separate explicit chat export. |
| `docs/` and `dist/site` | Provide one GitHub-readable learning sequence and a VitePress presentation that embeds isolated builds of the maintained examples and is published from validated `main`. |
| `tests/compatibility` | Delivers focused pinned client and transform comparisons, a composed v3 validate-to-transform smoke case, and grouped qualification output without network access. The evidence is representative and non-exhaustive. |

## What changed from earlier plans

These are superseded decisions, not an uncompleted backlog:

- The generalized `@sefaria/model` foundation and broad offline reference parser are no longer the delivery architecture. The corrected OpenAPI contract and thin `@sefaria/api-client` own transport data; elements own private component preparation.
- The earlier unbounded or implicit cache proposal was removed from the baseline. The current client instead implements one bounded, default-on, per-client response cache with explicit opt-out; retries and request coalescing remain excluded.
- A separate text-range request and view-model stack was replaced by a bounded source-card collection. A single segment is a one-item collection, while a range remains one outer request with card-level reference data.
- Attribution belongs once at the source-card level for each displayed edition, not inside every repeated text segment.
- The private `SourceCardData` MCP wire format is superseded. The current integration uses corrected API-shaped JSON, boundary validation, and the same element-owned private preparation as client mode.

The [historical decision record](evidence.md#historical-decision-provenance) explains the sources and supersession behind these changes. Work on other branches is not included in this baseline. Use the [repository issues](https://github.com/Sefaria/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/issues) page for live delivery tracking, not as the definition of a component contract.

## Still intended

These are remaining intended capabilities, not removed plans. A scaffold, command, or specification does not make them delivered.

| Planned loader | Intended result | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broader compatibility coverage | Extend the small current suite with additional source-backed cases, without promising exhaustive corpus equivalence | [Compatibility evidence](evidence.md#current-focused-compatibility-qualification) |

The client, text-transform foundations, current components, standalone Reader, contextual and multi-pane website Reader demos, same-App MCP Reader, named-host hierarchy acceptance, explicit chat export, and authored linked article are already delivered. New component slices still need concrete consumers; they do not justify restoring the superseded generalized model or hidden client policies.

TypeScript emits reusable ES modules. Vite builds the browser demonstrations and the single-file MCP App.

## Local documentation site

After a fresh checkout, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm build` before any direct `pnpm dev:*` example command. Those Vite development scripts resolve the workspace packages from their built `dist` exports. `pnpm dev:site` is the exception: it builds the maintained example inputs before starting VitePress.

Run the development site:

```powershell
pnpm dev:site
```

The command first builds isolated copies of the maintained browser examples, then starts VitePress over the canonical Markdown in `docs/`. The examples remain independent workspace projects and do not import one another at runtime. The local server does not change the deployment.

Build and preview the production artifact:

```powershell
pnpm build:site
pnpm preview:site
```

For documentation-site iteration, `pnpm check:site:fast` is an inner-loop shortcut. It formats and lints changed files, runs the documentation-site Vitest coverage that matches changed pages, and runs API-reference freshness or prose checks only when their inputs changed. Pass `--all` to select the complete fast loop, and expect it to fall back to that same broad selection when Git cannot determine the changed paths. This command is not final proof: `pnpm check:site` and especially `pnpm check` remain the acceptance gates before review.

The generated `dist/site` directory contains the VitePress pages plus allowlisted example routes under `examples/`: explorer, Reader, vanilla, React, Alpine, linked article, weekly portion, and the live static MCP host. The component guides retain focused editable samples, and the authored explorer provides supplied-data states. The live MCP host proves in-memory protocol, resource, AppBridge, and opaque-sandbox behavior without an external backend; `pnpm dev:mcp` proves the compiled Streamable HTTP topology.

`pnpm build:site` rebuilds the libraries and their packaged browser modules before script-source assembly, then typechecks each included example before bundling it. `pnpm build:site:bundles` reuses the browser modules and evidence from `pnpm build`, skips repeated typechecks, and is used inside `pnpm check` after workspace builds. Both commands verify required output files and reject a same-origin authored-source fallback. `SITE_BASE_PATH` selects the normalized absolute base used by VitePress, every example bundle, and browser acceptance; local commands default to `/`, while the Pages workflow requires `/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/`.

`main` holds next-release features and their documentation in the same pull requests. Pages builds downloadable main candidates without deployment. `release/docs` holds the published code, documentation, and runnable examples. Corrections land on `main` first. A reviewed cherry-pick copies the correction to `release/docs` without the unreleased features. Reviewers adapt conflicts to the published version.

Successful push CI on `release/docs` qualifies and promotes its current tip against the deployed version and original release source. This correction does not wait for a new npm publication. The future gate requires the public original handoff. Making that GitHub Release public remains a separate approved operation. Missing npm or CDN evidence stops the workflow. The workflow runs the repository gate and tests the original files, anonymous installation, both CDNs, and built package compatibility. It then tests the site against real pinned CDN modules. A receipt records the deployment selection. Pull requests never deploy.

Manual `maintain` and successful script retirement select the last deployed receipt, not latest main, and restore the current archive catalog. The recorded October 9 deployment at `47226ba0d4cb5ac8b018829e987376deaee6ea09`, Pages run `37920138687`, is the only receipt-free bootstrap and identifies npm `0.1.0-alpha.0` from release source `2d9cade6cc5b517d1ee4189e3a8d6e636cacde90`. Maintenance requalifies those artifacts before redeployment. Candidate modules are local; production imports pin npm versions. Archives remain intact.

The correction already exists on `main`, so the next release does not require a merge back from `release/docs`. A cherry-pick creates a different commit. The gate does not demand shared correction commits or prove that later edits preserve their meaning. Reviewers and tests own that behavior on each branch.

After the next release qualifies, advance `release/docs` through a reviewed merge from `main`. Resolve conflicts for the new version. Do not reset or force-push the branch. Those actions can remove reviewed history. For an approved promotion, dispatch `pages.yml` on main with `operation=promote`, `source=<current release/docs tip>`, `version=<verified version>` and `release_source=<original release SHA>`. A branch push keeps the deployed version and cannot automatically select a new release. Before upload, the workflow makes sure that the selected branch tip and successful deployment still match. A change to either stops the run, including stale maintenance. `scripts/npm-documentation-release.json` remains the sole recommendation owner. README and descriptive fields can change. Runtime files and all other package manifest contracts must match the original packages.

**Planned administrator setup:** after this workflow is reviewed and merged, separately authorize creation of `release/docs` from the reviewed compatible current-release source, no-force-push protection, review/check requirements, and eligibility for the `github-pages` environment. Do not initialize it from a main source that already contains unreleased features. The first deployment still needs the separately authorized public original handoff and qualification. The workflow creates no branch or protection settings. The previous Reveal.js showcase remains in the [documentation archive](archive/README.md#september-14-2026-presentation-snapshot).

## Keep the documentation current

The maintainer owns every page by default. Generated reference pages under `docs/reference` belong to their source JSDoc or TSDoc and to the generator in `scripts/reference`. Never edit generated Markdown. Change the source comment or the generator, then run `pnpm reference:generate`.

`scripts/npm-documentation-release.json` owns the exact published version recommended by consumer documentation. Advance it only after qualifying the next release, not merely when Changesets advances source manifests. The site runner, landing quick installs and generated assistant index read this input. `pnpm reference:generate` synchronizes current-version literals in stamped consumer Markdown and READMEs. Runnable HTML snippets use their exact elements import as the version anchor, without a maintenance stamp in copyable code. Raw files stay copyable without unresolved placeholders. `pnpm reference:check` rejects stale stamps or output. In a synchronized file, every occurrence of its anchored version is a current recommendation. Keep immutable launch history, release-administration commands, evidence and archived versions outside this synchronization set.

Update the docs when one of these happens:

- A public API or behavior changes. Update the page, the JSDoc, and the owning spec in the same change.
- An install or release step changes. Update the install pages and this guide.
- A live example or site test fails. Fix the example or the page that it proves.
- A link breaks, a question keeps coming back, or a status claim goes stale. Fix the page or mark the claim as planned.

These checks run in `pnpm check` and catch drift without a person:

- `pnpm reference:check` finds stale generated reference pages and consumer release-version references.
- `pnpm check:api-docs` finds missing public API documentation.
- `pnpm metadata:check` checks public metadata.
- `pnpm prose:check` lints the prose.
- `pnpm build:site:bundles` and the site tests check links, examples, and snippets.

A person must check behavior claims. A page that no person has reviewed carries `humanReviewed: false` in its front matter. That value shows a review box. Only a human removes it, after reading the page.

## Browser script distribution

For new browser integrations, use the packaged npm modules through jsDelivr or UNPKG. The legacy Pages script-source path remains implemented for offline browser acceptance and retained archive restoration; changing consumer recommendations does not retire it. New builds omit Popup; retained P5 pins keep their original bytes and API. The [distribution contract](specs/distribution.md#preserved-pages-cdn-and-gated-cutover) defines the separate operational cutover.

After building the workspace, run:

```powershell
pnpm build:script-source --compare
pnpm test:script-source dist/script-source
```

The first command writes `dist/script-source/sefaria-elements.js`, `sefaria-api-client.js`, `sefaria-text-transform.js`, licenses, a corresponding-source archive, a hashed manifest, and a comparison report. The second exercises that exact production artifact from a separate-origin plain HTML page in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. `pnpm check` stages the same artifact at `dist/site/cdn/local` and runs the smoke there. `local` is a fixture identity, never a publishable version; Pages restoration replaces the complete local `cdn` directory before upload.

The script smoke also drives real keyboard and pointer interactions at root and project URL bases: Source Card selection events received by ordinary host JavaScript, selected-state feedback, reversible language/vocalization controls, Reader commentary navigation and Back, narrow-screen pane switching, and no Popup registration or export. The production-site gate separately exercises the linked article's host dialog, Escape/button close, and originating-link focus return in all three browsers. It checks exact request counts after those actions. The pages import only the production bundle; Sefaria HTTP responses use the same bounded fixtures as site acceptance. This proves local interaction behavior, not the live Pages URL or upstream availability.

CI publishes neither packages nor script archives. Existing browser archives and Pages restoration remain intact until a separately authorized operational cutover, even when npm-backed CDN files are the recommended consumer route.

The automation-owned `script-distribution` branch stores `catalog.json`. Do not delete this branch or manually edit active hashes. Existing records and archive bytes remain authoritative; there is no new main-build archival job. Conflicting archived bytes require investigation, not overwrite.

Every Pages deployment reconstructs all active `cdn/<version>` directories from archived bytes. It verifies the archive inventory, file hashes, source/version identity, and size report before replacing the assembled directory. `cdn/alpha` selects the newest active producer run/attempt. Missing or corrupted active assets block deployment; restore the exact archived asset or explicitly retire the affected version. A normal Pages redeploy does not build a new release.

Restoration reports the complete site's byte size and blocks upload above 1,000,000,000 bytes, with the largest retained-version directories listed as cleanup candidates. Each retained directory includes its source archive, so growth requires deliberate maintenance; the budget check never retires a version automatically. Every GitHub request has a fresh 60-second deadline. Archive, Pages build, Pages deployment, and retirement jobs have outer limits of 30, 60, 15, and 10 minutes respectively.

The existing **Retire script version** owner records terminal tombstones and triggers Pages omission without deleting historical Release/source archives. A documentation update is not retirement authorization. Retirement of all active records belongs to the separately authorized post-qualification operational cutover; pins may then stop working and caches may delay removal. Never reuse a retired version identifier.

The supported Pages host is now `https://sefaria.github.io/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/`. The maintainer explicitly retired support for the old personal-account URLs after the ownership transfer. Restore retained artifacts byte-for-byte at the new host; do not rewrite their original licenses or filenames. Schema 1 releases contain only elements, schema 2 includes `sefaria-client.js`, and new schema 3 releases use `sefaria-api-client.js`.

Retained Pages qualification checks anonymous module loading, MIME/CORS, matching archive version, notices/source access, and an older active pin after a later deployment. npm CDN qualification instead compares against the captured npm release assets as described below. Local tests do not establish either host's availability.

## Workspace

| Path | Responsibility (status described above) |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/client` | Pinned OpenAPI input, formal guarded overlay, generated contracts, Zod schemas, validators, and tag-namespaced SDK functions |
| `packages/text-transform` | Pure sanitization, vocalization, and footnotes |
| `packages/web-components` | Declarative Lit elements, raw public input types, source, shared raw Reader source qualification, and the DOM-free Reader semantic/raw facade |
| `tests/compatibility` | Pinned compatibility evidence for retained pure behavior |
| `examples/explorer` | Supplied-data authored states and opt-in live diagnostics for component primitives and contextual connections |
| `examples/mcp-app` | Shared corrected-payload MCP registration, compiled stdio and Streamable HTTP servers, static in-browser MCP host, self-contained App, AppBridge sandbox hosts, and isolated VS Code qualification tooling |
| `examples/linked-article` | Authored native citation navigation and page-owned modal preview integration |
| `examples/reader` | Interactive multi-pane website host and controlled `<sefaria-reader>` host over the DOM-free reader session |
| `examples/vanilla-vite` | Minimal supplied-data and explicit-live public-package consumption path |
| `examples/react-vite` | React 19 Source Card data/`sref`, property, event, canonical-readout, and StrictMode integration |
| `examples/alpine-vite` | Alpine Source Card scalar attributes, property-only rich inputs, event, canonical-readout, and destroy integration |
| `docs/.vitepress` and `scripts/build-site.mjs` | Documentation presentation, project-path navigation, styling, and isolated example assembly |

Workspace dependencies use `workspace:*`, and committed manifests remain private at reviewed numbered versions. Successful `main` validation publishes nothing. Public npm staging does not change workspace dependency resolution.

## Required tools

Running the browser demos requires:

- Node.js 22.12 or later
- pnpm 11.22.0

Browser tests also require Chromium through Playwright.

The local deterministic browser acceptance uses the Playwright Chromium installation. An external MCP Apps-compatible host is optional for local App development and named-host qualification.

## Copilot agent and fresh-worktree setup

After Node.js and the pinned pnpm are available, prepare a fresh toolkit checkout with:

```powershell
pnpm setup:agent
```

The command performs a frozen install, installs Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, and launches and closes all three headless browsers. On Linux it also asks Playwright to install their system dependencies; that can require privileges supplied by the host. It uses the effective package-manager configuration and does not override registries. Historical test inventories are committed with their source repository and complete commit SHA, so setup does not need the original repository's Git objects.

Preparation can use the network for dependencies and browsers and fails at the exact unsuccessful step. `pnpm check` remains the offline validation boundary: it does not fetch Git history, refresh fixtures, or contact Sefaria.

GitHub's `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` first checks for `packages/web-components/package.json` with package name `@sefaria/web-components`. Toolkit-derived branches prepare normally; an unrelated checkout logs an explicit skip. A checkout that looks like the toolkit but lacks the setup script fails rather than silently skipping. This loader-based behavior must be verified in real cloud sessions after the workflow is active on `main`.

Copilot CLI and Desktop do not automatically run the hosted workflow. Run `pnpm setup:agent` in each fresh local worktree. Concurrent Vitest browser runs may begin with port `6338`; Vitest selects another port when it is occupied. Tests on September 15, 2026 confirmed this fallback, so no custom port allocator is required.

## Install the workspace

For browser-only TypeScript work, run these commands from the repository root:

```powershell
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec playwright install chromium firefox webkit
```

If Corepack is unavailable, install the pinned pnpm release through your approved package-management path, then run the same commands. Do not let a transient executor download an unpinned tool.

The individual commands remain useful for targeted troubleshooting. Prefer `pnpm setup:agent` for a complete fresh-agent or fresh-worktree preparation.

## Current complete check

```powershell
pnpm check
```

The current command runs Prettier and Oxlint first, then stale-OpenAPI and integration-policy checks, workspace builds, official Inspector stdio qualification, deterministic real HTTP/AppBridge browser acceptance, TypeScript checks, freshly emitted API-documentation checks, public metadata, and tests. It then runs the slower production local-site assembly and site and script-source browser acceptance, followed by the offline focused compatibility qualification, private tarball consumption, and changeset rehearsal. Cheap and frequently failing stages run before the browser suites so that a failure is reported early. It prints the elapsed time and result of every completed stage, including the first failed stage, so a slow local run can be attributed without rerunning the complete gate. The qualification prints grouped pass, failure, unavailable-source, and intentional-difference results. It does not refresh network fixtures or contact Sefaria.

Every run writes a bounded machine-readable result to `.artifacts/check/result.json`. CI uploads that result and allowlisted browser diagnostics only after a platform failure. A Linux success cannot hide a Windows failure: the required `check` aggregation succeeds only when the complete matrix succeeds.

Pages runs the complete `pnpm check` on its explicitly selected source with `/sefaria-frontend-toolkit/` as the base. A second site-only build binds either candidate-local modules or the selected exact npm version before acceptance/upload. The main controller and documentation checkout are separate and pinned within each run. CI and Pages cache Playwright browsers by operating system and lockfile hash. `pnpm setup:agent` still runs its three-browser launch probe.

### Documentation-site inner loop

```powershell
pnpm check:site
```

This subset runs Prettier, Oxlint, integration policy, workspace builds, TypeScript checks including documentation snippets, API-documentation checks, the production site assembly, and site browser acceptance. Use it while iterating on documentation-site pages and site snippets. It omits package tests, public metadata, the script-source browser suite, MCP acceptance, compatibility, tarball, and changeset stages. If a change touches packages, component behavior, or examples used outside the site, run the matching focused command as well. `pnpm check:site` never replaces `pnpm check`: run the complete check before review.

The MCP acceptance transport rejects unexpected requests and uses the compiled Node server, registered resource, separate host and sandbox origins, and packaged App. TypeScript projects use ignored incremental build-information files, which reduce repeated local typecheck and build work without changing emitted artifacts.

Repository validation scripts set `windowsHide: true` when starting subprocesses so Windows console windows do not appear for those commands. Existing inherited or captured stdout and stderr remain unchanged.

The site build script builds examples through Vite's Node API. Declaration checks, custom-elements analysis, and VitePress use the installed package's CLI entry point through Node rather than `pnpm exec` and a platform shell. These tools retain separate processes where isolation is useful; pnpm still owns workspace scripts, dependency installation, and package operations.

The deterministic gate does not contact Sefaria. To opt into a bounded live-data qualification of every maintained click-to-start route, including one Reader navigation and the embedded MCP text-to-links flow, run:

```powershell
pnpm test:site:live
```

This command rebuilds the production site, requires zero Sefaria requests before each activation, validates the returned live data through the production clients and factories, and exits nonzero with the failing route and stage. It uses bounded Micah references and request limits but does not assert a fixed live connection count or rewrite committed fixtures. Passing locally qualifies current CORS and payload availability; deployed Pages-origin evidence remains separate.

## Current focused checks

Run all TypeScript tests:

```powershell
pnpm test
```

Run the current focused compatibility qualification:

```powershell
pnpm compatibility:qualify
```

The command runs offline against committed and source-derived fixtures. It exits nonzero only for unexpected failures; unavailable sources and documented intentional differences remain separate visible result classes. The suite is representative and non-exhaustive.

Run the compatibility tests, including output semantics and network denial:

```powershell
pnpm exec vitest run tests/compatibility
```

Run the official Inspector against the compiled stdio server:

```powershell
pnpm build:mcp
pnpm --filter @sefaria-example/mcp-app inspect:stdio
```

Run the deterministic stdio, Streamable HTTP, resource, AppBridge, sandbox, and browser acceptance:

```powershell
pnpm --filter @sefaria-example/mcp-app demo
```

## OpenAPI workflow

### Explicit refresh

The refresh operation requires a complete Sefaria commit SHA. It can access the network.

```powershell
pnpm openapi:refresh --commit 898feda78d1bd6b24f66305081a54c8cf36406be
```

The operation downloads only the OpenAPI document from that commit. It validates the formal overlay guards before updating the committed pin, upstream input, SHA-256, and generated TypeScript.

It then applies the local overlay, creates the corrected document in temporary storage, and regenerates the TypeScript contracts and runtime validators.

### Offline generation

```powershell
pnpm openapi:generate
```

The operation validates the checksum and co-located overlay guards, applies `openapi/overlay.yaml` through `openapi-format` 1.33.6, extracts eight reviewed Core GET/POST operations and recursive references into temporary storage, and runs `@hey-api/openapi-ts` 0.99.0.

The generator configures a deterministic Zod object resolver for every retained `additionalProperties: false` schema. It also maps the explicitly typed OpenAPI 3.0 null-only branches to `z.null()` and applies the `minProperties: 1` warning-record correction that Hey API 0.99 does not emit correctly.

Refresh writes every new file into a sibling staging directory. Publication moves existing outputs to a rollback directory, replaces the generated TypeScript directory, then publishes `upstream.json` and `source.json` last. Any replacement failure restores every prior output.

It must not access Sefaria, GitHub, the current time, or environment-specific data.

### Stale-output check

```powershell
pnpm openapi:check
```

The check fails for changed, missing, or unexpected generated files. `pnpm check` includes this operation.

### Overlay failure

If upstream content differs from an asserted old value, generation stops with an exact path:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
OpenAPI precondition mismatch for versions-contract at $.paths['/api/texts/versions/{index}']
expected: SHA-256 <reviewed value>
actual: <current value>
```

The developer must review the new upstream document. Do not change an assertion only to make generation pass.

### Drift detection

`pnpm openapi:drift` compares the committed pin's commit and checksum with upstream. It can access the network and changes no repository file:

```powershell
pnpm openapi:drift
pnpm openapi:drift --report drift.json
```

It resolves the latest commit on Sefaria's default branch that changed `docs/openAPI.json`, downloads the file at that SHA, and prints the changed paths, changed schemas, and every overlay guard that would fail. The command exits `0` for both no drift and drift; read the printed status or the JSON report. It exits nonzero when a request, status, commit lookup, or JSON parse fails, so a failure never looks like no drift. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise the GitHub API rate limit.

The upstream repository lookup and the Octokit issue and handoff requests explicitly use GitHub REST API version `2026-03-10`. When changing the API version, review [GitHub's breaking changes](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/about-the-rest-api/breaking-changes) for the endpoints the command uses and smoke-test the issue upsert; omitting the header currently selects the older `2022-11-28` version.

The `OpenAPI drift` workflow (`.github/workflows/openapi-drift.yml`) runs the same command daily at 06:17 UTC and on manual dispatch, always using the repository default-branch checkout. Its detection job has only `contents: read` and `issues: write`. With `--issue`, the command creates or updates one open issue labeled `openapi-drift` while the pin differs, comments when the upstream commit moves, and closes the issue with a resolution note when a later scan sees the exact upstream commit and checksum pinned on the default branch. A subsequent upstream change opens a new issue. A scan failure never closes an issue. The triage draft PR links the issue without a closing keyword; its merge alone does not resolve the episode.

When the issue is new or the upstream commit moves, a second job assigns the issue to the Copilot coding agent with the [`openapi-drift-triage`](../.github/agents/openapi-drift-triage.agent.md) custom agent. That agent expands referenced upstream and overlay-created objects to compare the resulting meaning across every affected consumer. An upstream equivalent of an existing reviewed correction can replace the redundant overlay action and guard; new or partially different behavior needs source review and bounded, source-directed requests to public, safe Sefaria endpoints. The agent records dated runtime evidence, assesses whether an upstream or new shared transport component fits all consumers, and then proposes a pinned refresh or overlay update as a draft PR. A local MongoDB export can corroborate a branch but is neither required nor an HTTP response authority. If evidence does not establish the contract, the agent leaves the pin unchanged and documents the gap in an investigation-only draft. It does not manage the drift issue; a human still performs the source review. GitHub requires a user token to assign Copilot, so this step uses the optional `COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN` repository secret: a fine-grained personal access token for this repository only, with read and write access to actions, contents, issues, and pull requests, owned by a user with Copilot. Without that secret the job logs a notice and a maintainer can assign the issue to Copilot from the issue page. If the assignment request fails, or Copilot is already assigned when a later commit arrives, the run fails with a manual-reassignment instruction; an add-assignee request would otherwise appear to succeed without starting a new agent session. The issue already records the new commit. The first automatic handoff has not yet run, so the handoff path is implemented but unverified in production. `pnpm integration:check` pins this workflow's triggers, job permissions, commands, and its only permitted secret reference.

## Client fixture candidate capture

The current Genesis index candidate capture is explicit and networked. Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the actual caller-declared capture date:

```powershell
pnpm client:fixture:capture-candidate --write --capture-date YYYY-MM-DD
```

The command requires exactly `--write --capture-date YYYY-MM-DD`. It refuses an invalid date or an existing `index-genesis-YYYY-MM-DD.json` before fetching. It then fetches only the deployed Genesis index URL declared by the immutable September 1 manifest entry, validates the unknown response with the generated public validator, deterministically reduces it, stages it beside the fixture directory, verifies the dated target is still absent, and publishes the new candidate with one same-filesystem rename. Download, JSON parsing, validation, reduction, or publication failure leaves committed evidence unchanged.

Candidate generation does not update `manifest.json`, tests, or other references and is not automatic baseline replacement. A reviewer must inspect the candidate and manually update provenance and references in the same reviewed change if it should become committed evidence. The committed `index-genesis-2026-09-01.json` remains immutable. Existing prose-reduced payloads, reduced captures for the other Core endpoints, and hand-extracted markup fragments remain manual-review-only because their reductions depend on source interpretation rather than a general capture rule.

## Generated artifacts

`@sefaria/api-client` commits:

- the upstream OpenAPI input
- the complete commit pin
- the SHA-256
- the formal Overlay 1.1 document with co-located old-state guards
- generated named SDK functions and TypeScript operation declarations
- generated Zod schemas, status-aware response metadata, and public validators

Generated TypeScript files live under `packages/client/src/generated` and identify their source pin and generation command. The corrected Core OpenAPI document exists only in temporary generation storage.

Do not edit generated declarations by hand.

## Run the component explorer

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

The landing page links to authored states and click-to-start live diagnostics. Authored states exercise production elements without requests; live pages use ordinary HTML controls, the production client, tagged source, and declarative elements. Opening the landing page or any live route does not contact Sefaria before **Start live demo**, an example preset, or an authored citation is activated.

## Run the interactive text-segment page

```powershell
pnpm dev:text-segment
```

The page uses ordinary HTML controls and the production client. It calls the deployed Sefaria API, owns cancellation and host errors, and supplies each result to `<sefaria-text-segment>`.

## Run the interactive bilingual-segment page

```powershell
pnpm dev:bilingual-segment
```

The page makes one request for the source and translation versions of a segment. Its display controls change the visible sides, the layout, and the side order without making another request.

## Run the contextual connections reader

```powershell
pnpm dev:connections
```

The host loads a connection target and its server-provided parent section when necessary, selects the first target segment, and requests that segment's links. Reader-row selection makes only a links request. Category changes, 20-entry paging, and showing or hiding captured previews make no request. A labels-only links response exposes an explicit Load previews action rather than fetching inside the element.

## Run the multi-pane website reader

```powershell
pnpm dev:reader
```

The command serves two linked interactive pages. The root page is a realistic regular-website consumer rather than a component state gallery: its host uses one DOM-free reader session for semantic entries and capture retention, while demo-private state owns ordered pane IDs, parent relationships, compact selection, and the 20-visible-pane limit. Wide containers scroll horizontally across independently scrolling source and connections panes; compact containers show one selected pane and a path switch.

`/controlled.html` demonstrates the ordinary standalone Reader path. The host supplies an explicit client data source, assigns `sref` after activation, observes read-only Reader diagnostics, and keeps one persistent element. Reader owns continuing requests, cancellation, semantic history, Back, breadcrumbs, external root replacement, and local connections projection.

## Run the MCP App server

```powershell
pnpm dev:mcp
```

The current command:

1. Builds the single-file MCP App, reference host, sandbox, and Node server.
2. Starts the compiled Streamable HTTP server plus separate host and sandbox origins.
3. Opens the reference browser host.

The server exposes `get_text(reference, version_language="both")`. It requests the deployed Sefaria v3 texts endpoint and returns one progressive result: plain text for every host, corrected API-shaped `structuredContent`, request/status metadata, and the App resource. The public `source`, `english`, and `both` choices select the source-card primary and translation roles through `version=primary`, `version=translation`, or both repeated values. The App bundles the generated validator and source-card factory into the staged HTML; no separate validator or payload fixture is staged.

VS Code reads the checked-in `.vscode/mcp.json`. It starts the compiled Node stdio server with `${workspaceFolder}`, so the configuration stays portable across worktrees.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sefaria-components-demo": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/examples/mcp-app/dist/server/stdio.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The resource URI is `ui://sefaria/source-card.html`. Its MIME type is `text/html;profile=mcp-app`.

The server request is live. The App's local-loader first render makes no duplicate request, and repository tests mock the server transport so `pnpm check` remains offline.

Build and stage the App before opening the workspace in VS Code:

```powershell
pnpm build:mcp
```

In Copilot Chat Agent mode, enable the `sefaria-components-demo` tools and ask it to use `get_text` for a reference such as `Leviticus 19:18`.

Prepare the persistent isolated VS Code environment before the first automated run:

```powershell
pnpm setup:mcp:vscode
```

The command builds the App and Node server, creates dedicated user-data, extensions, Copilot home, shared-data, and process-home directories under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SefariaMcpDemo`, writes deterministic user settings, writes empty VS Code and Agent Host MCP configurations, clears stale chat and MCP tool caches without deleting authentication state, and opens the worktree in that environment. The profile disables MCP discovery, MCP gallery browsing, plugins, and Settings Sync; ignores extension recommendations; and uses the empty extensions directory so no user-installed extensions are loaded. `COPILOT_HOME`, `HOME`, and `USERPROFILE` point at dedicated directories so Agent Host and customization discovery do not load servers, settings, plugins, agents, or other state from the standard user home. The explicit shared-data directory prevents VS Code from reading application state from the machine-wide `.vscode-shared` directory. VS Code's bundled Copilot and core built-in extensions remain available.

The isolated Copilot permission file records approval only for the `sefaria-components-demo` MCP server for this worktree. VS Code `1.137.0` still presents its normal host approval control for the tool call, so the acceptance harness clicks **Allow in this Session**. It does not enable bypass permissions, broad MCP auto-approval, writes, terminal commands, URLs, or any other server.

Sign in to GitHub Copilot once in that window, confirm the `sefaria-components-demo` workspace server when prompted, and close the window. Authentication remains in the dedicated user-data directory and is not committed.

The Playwright acceptance harness then launches a fresh VS Code process with that same user-data and extensions pair, connects over a reserved CDP port, accepts the narrow session approval, and runs the integrated Reader walkthrough. Screenshots remain under the ignored repository-local `.artifacts/vscode-mcp` staging area until every stage passes; then capture mode publishes the three maintained screenshots and `docs/images/mcp-app-vscode-walkthrough.json`. A failed walkthrough preserves the previous outputs and reports its diagnostic directory.

```powershell
pnpm walkthrough:mcp:vscode
```

The walkthrough writes its machine-readable result to `.artifacts/vscode-mcp/walkthrough.json` and publishes no screenshots. To run the same full walkthrough and, only after complete success, publish the three maintained initial Reader, retained hierarchy, and explicit chat-export screenshots plus `docs/images/mcp-app-vscode-walkthrough.json`:

```powershell
pnpm capture:mcp:vscode
```

To open the prepared isolated workspace without automation:

```powershell
pnpm launch:mcp:vscode
```

On Windows, the Node commands use a narrow PowerShell native-process helper that calls `CreateProcessW` with `SW_SHOWMINIMIZED`, `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, an exact quoted argument vector, the isolated environment, and the requested working directory. The helper returns the created process PID; cleanup closes that window and then terminates the exact remaining process tree if necessary. Only walkthrough and capture enable the smoke-test driver and a reserved debugging port. Launch-only does not attach CDP, drive the UI, submit a prompt, or call a tool. Data navigation during walkthrough remains in one App through host-proxied tools. Explicit chat export fills the real composer through `ui/message`; the harness verifies that text without submitting it and records `host-message`.

`VSCODE_MCP_PROFILE_ROOT` overrides the default profile root. `VSCODE_USER_DATA_DIR`, `VSCODE_EXTENSIONS_DIR`, `VSCODE_EXECUTABLE_PATH`, `VSCODE_MCP_SCREENSHOT`, and `VSCODE_MCP_RESULT` override their individual paths. Failed walkthrough diagnostics remain under `.artifacts/vscode-mcp` and do not replace maintained screenshots or the maintained result.

The dedicated user-data, shared-data, Copilot home, and process-home directories are intentionally separate from the standard VS Code and Agent Host profiles. This guarantees a distinct Electron process, makes the CDP port reliable even while normal VS Code windows are open, excludes standard-profile MCP servers and shared application state, and avoids copying authentication or secret-storage files. A normal named profile can share standard-profile authentication, but it does not provide the same process or Agent Host configuration isolation.

## Run the authored linked article

```powershell
pnpm dev:linked-article
```

The development server shows the authored article page. The native citation is present in static HTML; the module enhancement opens a host-owned native dialog and assigns Source Card `sref` only after an eligible unmodified activation.

The [authored linked-article guide](examples/linked-article.md) covers native fallback, page-owned request lifecycle, strict deterministic transport, and the immutable archive for the retired automatic Linker.

The browser tests exercise Source Card source through a strict fixture fetch that accepts only the expected method, origin, decoded `Micah 6:8` path, and ordered query. Separate Playwright coverage starts the actual page on an assigned loopback port with JavaScript disabled and proves that activation follows the authored Sefaria URL.

## Build artifacts

Build all packages and demonstrations:

```powershell
pnpm build
```

Build only the current MCP App, host, sandbox, and Node server:

```powershell
pnpm build:mcp
```

The App build creates `examples/mcp-app/dist/app/mcp-app.html`; compiled server entries are under `examples/mcp-app/dist/server`, and host assets are under `examples/mcp-app/dist/host`.

The linked-article build creates `examples/linked-article/dist`.

If a required input file is missing, staging stops.

### Build and pack the library tarballs

The normal build creates `dist` JavaScript and declarations before workspace consumers typecheck:

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
$repository = (Resolve-Path .).Path
$destination = Join-Path $repository ".toolchain\tarballs"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $destination
pnpm --filter @sefaria/api-client pack --pack-destination $destination
pnpm --filter @sefaria/text-transform pack --pack-destination $destination
pnpm --filter @sefaria/web-components pack --pack-destination $destination
```

`pnpm --filter ... pack` runs from each package directory, so the absolute destination is intentional. Copy the three emitted tarballs into an external Vite project and use the actual filenames in its `package.json`:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@sefaria/api-client": "file:./sefaria-api-client-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz",
    "@sefaria/text-transform": "file:./sefaria-text-transform-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz",
    "@sefaria/web-components": "file:./sefaria-web-components-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz"
  }
}
```

Put matching transitive overrides in the external consumer's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
overrides:
  "@sefaria/api-client": "file:./sefaria-api-client-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz"
  "@sefaria/text-transform": "file:./sefaria-text-transform-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz"
  "@sefaria/web-components": "file:./sefaria-web-components-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz"

allowBuilds:
  esbuild: true
```

### Numbered npm releases

GitHub Packages publishing/bootstrap, registry-only checks and both legacy activation flags are removed. Ordinary CI retains shared complete Linux/Windows validation and fail-closed `check`, with no package or script-archive writes.

The initial numbered version is `0.1.0-alpha.0`, selected by the installed Changesets CLI from the actual pending main-baseline Changesets. The source-stamped fixture in `tests/fixtures/initial-changesets.json` reproduces that exact initial input without historical Git objects during `pnpm check`. For package changes, add a note with the installed `pnpm exec changeset` command. Later version PRs use `pnpm exec changeset version` while in alpha mode; stable transitions use `pnpm exec changeset pre exit` followed by `pnpm exec changeset version`. Review the complete synchronized manifests, dependency versions and changelogs before release. Keep source manifests `private: true` with `workspace:*`; only isolated public staging rewrites them. Documentation-only updates neither authorize a release nor replace assets of an already published version. Updating consumer guidance for an already-verified npm/CDN version does not require another publication or public GitHub Release finalization.

The manual `release-npm.yml` caller has `prepare`, `publish`, and `verify-finalize` operations with exact source/version inputs. Preparation runs complete Linux/Windows checks, builds once per platform, packs public npm tarballs and qualifies actual framework/browser consumers. Matching cross-platform bytes are uploaded to one SHA-bound draft GitHub Release with manifest, checksums and maintainer commands. Only draft-assets and finalization receive `contents: write`; preparation receives no npm OIDC. The draft-assets job also owns GET-only capture before approval, because GitHub requires push access to see drafts. Administrators configure and confirm `npm-release` with the designated Sefaria approver and main-only branch rule during setup. Self-review and administrator bypass are allowed; publication/finalization rely on native GitHub approval, with no per-run configuration API guard.

For the first release, an authorized Sefaria npm maintainer downloads and checks that draft's actual `.tgz` assets and publishes with their own account/2FA. Avi needs no npm membership or manual file-transfer role. The draft's `MAINTAINER-COMMANDS.ps1` supplies the exact release link, download/checksum and ordered public npm commands. Source-code archives are not npm packages.

The later trusted-publishing path is implemented but requires its own provider setup and hosted qualification; successful first publication does not prove it. It captures the exact draft assets before environment approval, then uses pinned Node 22.14.0 and npm 11.5.2 with job-scoped OIDC. No rebuild, repack, arbitrary command/registry or permanent token fallback is permitted. Explicit resume verifies every existing exact version before skipping it. Any conflicting bytes/dependencies/source fail; partial publication leaves the draft and assets intact. Verification checks all three npm records, integrity, dependencies, dist-tags and anonymous installed imports before the separate finalization job makes that same release public. Alpha is a prerelease and is not deliberately promoted to latest.

Local preparation after building uses `RELEASE_VERSION` and `RELEASE_SOURCE` with `pnpm release:prepare`; hosted writes remain separately authorized manual operations. `pnpm package:smoke` also rehearses real public npm staging and the same browser/framework consumers offline, not just the private source packages. It cleans disposable qualification assets; it does not establish hosted availability.

Explicit read-only hosted verification requires the original downloaded qualified assets, not a rebuild from a later documentation commit. For the initial release, put its six assets in `.artifacts/npm-release` and run on a host with anonymous npm/CDN access:

```powershell
$env:RELEASE_VERSION = "0.1.0-alpha.0"
$env:RELEASE_SOURCE = "2d9cade6cc5b517d1ee4189e3a8d6e636cacde90"
pnpm release:verify
pnpm release:verify-cdn -- .artifacts/npm-release
```

For later releases, replace both values with the version and full source SHA from that release's manifest. The CDN command compares all three modules/notices against jsDelivr and UNPKG and exercises real CDN imports and bounded live Micah requests in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. These commands are not part of offline `pnpm check`. Do not infer readiness from status 200 or local files. No browser-file export-map additions are made without actual UNPKG qualification.

See [Release administration](release-administration.md) for standalone external prerequisites. Sefaria reviewer selection, npm namespace ownership, initial publisher/draft access, native approval behavior and later trusted publishing remain externally owned. The read-only environment inventory is recorded in [Evidence](evidence.md#npm-only-release-engineering); naming the environment alone does not establish its protection.

`pnpm build` writes each package's self-contained browser module under `dist/browser`, with MIT and dependency notices. `pnpm package:smoke` extracts actual tarballs and loads those files from a separate-origin static host and opaque sandbox in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit before framework-consumer qualification. CDN-ready contents are not npm publication.

The same build writes private `.artifacts/package-browser-build.json` evidence for those modules. `pnpm build:script-source` reuses their exact bytes and captured dependency graph, verifies current input/output fingerprints, and creates the combined notices, manifest, and source archive without rebundling. If the evidence or an input/output file is missing, malformed, or stale, run `pnpm build` again; assembly does not rebuild silently. The evidence is not shipped in package tarballs. The optional `--compare` mode still builds the explicit split-module comparison. Retained hosted releases continue to restore from their original archives.

Run `pnpm package:smoke` to create an isolated Vite consumer, inspect each unchanged packed manifest and file list, override all three internal toolkit dependencies to their exact `file:` tarballs, inspect the lockfile and installed real paths, remove the producer tarballs, build, import the Node-safe subpaths, and render the source-card path in Chromium. Consumer-side overrides are required for this local private-tarball topology because pnpm otherwise attempts registry resolution for a packed package's internal toolkit dependency.

Run `pnpm metadata:generate` after changing a public export or element contract. `pnpm metadata:check` rejects stale `packages/web-components/custom-elements.json`, `packages/public-exports.json`, and their readable summaries under `docs/reference/`.

Then run `pnpm reference:generate`. It rebuilds the site's reference pages from those files, the OpenAPI overlay, the client and text-transform source (through TypeDoc), and the hand-written catalogs in `scripts/reference/`. `pnpm reference:check`, part of `pnpm check` and `pnpm check:site`, rejects a stale page. It's separate from the JSDoc coverage in `pnpm check:api-docs`.

Run `pnpm changeset:rehearse` to exercise first/subsequent alpha and stable exit in a disposable fixed-group fixture, synchronized dependencies/changelogs, private flags and no automatic commit/tag. The initial actual-input regression separately proves the requested `0.1.0-alpha.0` release.

## Package index configuration

Keep package-index configuration outside the repository. pnpm can record mirror-specific tarball URLs. Make sure that `pnpm-lock.yaml` contains no private registry URL before a commit.

## Tool boundaries

Vite builds browser artifacts. TypeScript builds reusable ES modules.

Vitest runs TypeScript unit and protocol tests. Vitest Browser Mode and Playwright run Lit tests in Chromium. The official MCP Inspector qualifies the compiled stdio server, and the deterministic local harness exercises the compiled stdio and Streamable HTTP transports through the real AppBridge host and packaged App.

### Why this repository uses Oxlint

The repository moved away from ESLint because its required TypeScript integration was not compatible with the compiler upgrade: `typescript-eslint` 8.67.0 officially supports TypeScript versions below 6.1, not TypeScript 7. ESLint core alone does not provide the TypeScript parsing and rules this workspace used, so retaining the ESLint toolchain would have kept the workspace compiler on TypeScript 6.

The workspace uses TypeScript 7.0.2 and native Oxlint rules. `pnpm lint` does not enable Oxlint's type-aware rules; `pnpm typecheck` remains the compiler-owned type gate.

`pnpm check:api-docs` removes and freshly emits declaration files for handwritten package source and client scripts, then parses those declarations and requires JSDoc on exported declarations, exported interface properties, and public class properties. It ignores generated declarations and compiler-emitted private fields. This output check replaces the former `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` source check because Oxlint's JavaScript-plugin selector engine did not visit an exported class property during qualification.

`@hey-api/openapi-ts` 0.99.0 still uses the TypeScript 6 compiler API. `packages/client` therefore pins TypeScript 6.0.3 for that generator only. Its `build` and `typecheck` scripts explicitly invoke the workspace-root TypeScript 7 compiler. Do not remove the local generator pin or the workspace-root compiler invocation independently; `tests/toolchain-versions.test.ts` enforces both sides of this boundary.

TypeDoc 0.28 also needs the TypeScript 6 compiler API. The generated client and text-transform reference pages use it through `pnpm reference:generate`, so the private `tests/reference-docs` workspace package pins `typedoc`, `typedoc-plugin-markdown` and TypeScript 6.0.3 for that generator only. `tests/toolchain-versions.test.ts` enforces this pin too. Remove the package when TypeDoc supports TypeScript 7 ([TypeStrong/typedoc#3098](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/3098)).

This arrangement separates four responsibilities: Oxlint performs explicitly configured syntax and source-quality checks, the workspace TypeScript 7 compiler owns typechecking and package output, the API-documentation check owns JSDoc enforcement on freshly emitted public declarations, and the client-local TypeScript 6 compiler exists only inside the OpenAPI generator. It is a qualified compatibility arrangement, not a claim that Oxlint and declaration-output analysis are universally better than ESLint and source-AST plugins.

Reconsider ESLint when its TypeScript integration officially supports the workspace TypeScript version and the required source-level JSDoc policy can run without an incompatible compiler or plugin boundary. Also reconsider the choice if Oxlint loses required rule parity, develops platform reliability problems, or makes the lint policy materially harder to maintain. Evaluate a return with the repository's executable counterexamples, full checks, cross-platform runs, and measured performance rather than ecosystem preference alone. Do not remove the declaration-output check until a replacement demonstrably covers its exported-declaration and public-property cases; the client-local TypeScript 6 generator boundary is an independent compatibility issue.

The workspace does not use Nx or Turborepo. Add another task layer only after the pnpm scripts fail a measured need.
