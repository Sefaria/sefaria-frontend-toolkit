## Short answers

**Will it work in my stack?** The components work in any modern browser that runs JavaScript. The client and text tools also run in Node.js. For Python or other languages, call [Sefaria's API](https://developers.sefaria.org) directly.

**How do I install it?** Use the public `@sefaria` npm packages at `0.1.0-alpha.0`, or copy the version-pinned browser script from [Start here](/use-components/start-here.md). No registry token or build step is needed for the script route.

**Is it official?** It is Sefaria-owned and community-driven with Sefaria backing and support. It remains experimental, not a promise of stable APIs or a support SLA. It began at the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2026.

**Why web components?** A web component is a custom HTML tag, like `<sefaria-source-card>`. The same tag works in plain HTML, React, Alpine, and other frameworks.

**Should I use this or Sefaria's own tools?** Use Sefaria's API, Linker, source sheets, or data exports when they already do the job. Use this toolkit to put Sefaria texts inside your own JavaScript page or app.
